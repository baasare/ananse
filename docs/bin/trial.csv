This study aims to develop a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to suggest a method for the proper installation of a wind monitoring system in a forested mountainous region. The inertial resistance coefficients of the canopy of coniferous and deciduous trees were measured through field experiments to simulate the wind environment in a mountainous region by considering the air resistance of trees. The averaged coefficients of the inertial resistance of coniferous and deciduous trees were 0.768 and 0.712 m-1, respectively. The developed open-source CFD model was validated using the measured field experiment data. The economic mesh size and a proper turbulence model were a 6.25 m and a standard k–ε turbulence model to simulate the wind environment in the selected forested mountainous region. Using the validated CFD model, the wind environments were analysed according to various environmental conditions, such as air resistance of trees, tree height, and diameter of the clear-cut, and a proper installation method for the mountain meteorological observation system to observe the wind was proposed based on the simulated results. © 2019 IAgrE",Complex terrain; Computational fluid dynamics; Mountainous terrain; Open-source CFD; Tree porosity,Computational fluid dynamics; Data handling; Forestry; Landforms; Turbulence models; Viruses; Weather information services; Complex terrains; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Environmental conditions; Installation methods; Meteorological observation; Mountainous terrain; Open sources; Resistance coefficients; Monitoring,"Lee, I.-B.1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, South Korea; email: iblee@snu.ac.kr",,Academic Press,15375110,,BEINB,,English,Biosyst.

This study ascertained local communities’ perception of the importance of non-market ecosystem services, the impact of illegal mining on ecosystem services, and their likeliness to participate in restoration of degraded lands resulting from illegal mining. Fifty respondents each were purposefully selected from three mining communities (Ntakam, Asawinso No.1 and Nkatieso) in a survey. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests results indicated there were no difference in views of respondents regarding the importance of forest for various non-market services. Illegal mining activities were identified as the cause of environmental problems such as water pollution, deforestation, poor soil fertility and limited access to land for agriculture productivity. Majority of respondents across the three communities indicated that forest is very important for non-market environmental services. Logistic regression results indicated that factors that affect likeliness to participate in restoration financing included income, embracing non-market ecosystem services as important, confidence in PES schemes and positive value motivation for restoration (altruistic, use and bequest values). © 2019 The Author(s)",Community participation; Degraded mined sites; Ecosystem services; Ghana; Illegal mining; Restoration,,"Obeng, E.A.; CSIR-Forestry Research Institute of Ghana, P.O.

This research involved analysing soil disturbance from salvage logging in four mountain forests, managed with close-to-nature silviculture: the Hyrcanian forest (three forest compartments in Iran), using extraction by skidder, and the Camaldoli forest (one parcel in Italy), using extraction by tractor. The point transect method was used for assessing soil disturbance and also included further measurements of ruts’ size and selected physical soil parameters on skid trails after operation. After a windstorm, more than 94% and 17% of the area were undisturbed in the Hyrcanian and Camaldoli forests, respectively. Bulk density, penetration resistance, and pH did not show any significant differences with their average values specifically between disturbed and undisturbed soil after a windstorm. Related only to the effect of salvage logging, more than 80% of the area was undisturbed. The results were significantly lower in terms of the average values of soil variables such as bulk density, penetration resistance, and total porosity in disturbed soil than in undisturbed soil. For all the sites that were studied, bulk density and penetration resistance increased with the increasing number of machines that passes, while total porosity decreased. The results showed significant positive correlations between bulk density and penetration resistance, bulk density and pH value, and total porosity and pH value and significant negative correlations between bulk density and total porosity and penetration resistance and total porosity. The results indicated that the point transect method of assessing soil disturbance provides a rapid assessment of soil conditions for monitoring soil disturbance after salvage logging. Our results also indicated that to reduce impacts to soil during salvage logging, if the volume of windthrow timber is low, salvage logging is not always necessary because of the broad ecological importance as well as the economic aspects of dead wood in forest ecosystems. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",High forest; Salvage logging; Skidding; Soil disturbance; Windthrow,bulk density; climate effect; environmental disturbance; forest ecosystem; forestry production; logging (timber); silviculture; wind forcing; wind velocity; Iran; Italy,"Picchio, R.; Department of Agriculture and Forest Sciences (DAFNE), Tuscia University, Via S.

High resolution LiDAR data were used to assess light availability to understory vegetation, which in turn was converted into an understory vegetation cover ratio. Spatially distributed infiltration capacities based on data from field rainfall-runoff experiments were incorporated into the TopoTube model using a relationship between infiltration capacity and vegetation cover. Effects of spatial distribution of infiltration capacity and its influence on hydrological connectivity and runoff processes were examined based on numerical simulations in the following three infiltration scenarios for seven natural storms: (1) spatially distributed infiltration capacity; (2) uniform infiltration capacity using the weighted mean of the spatial distribution in the drainage basin; and (3) uniform infiltration capacity using the arithmetic mean of field measurements. Although saturated subsurface flow dominated storm runoff in all simulations, Hortonian and saturated overland flow were significant for storm runoff response in smaller catchments (headwaters and zero-order basins). Simulations using spatially distributed infiltration capacities showed more Hortonian overland flow compared to using uniform infiltration because of areas with low infiltration located along channels. On the other hand, no differences in runoff were apparent between spatially-distributed and uniform infiltration scenarios in larger catchments. Our study also indicates that differences in contributions of subsurface and groundwater flow at the catchment scale need to be examined based on observations and simulations in nested catchments. Our findings suggest that including detailed patterns of vegetation ground cover are important for understanding hydrogeomorphic connectivity within catchments. © 2019",Flow path; Hydrological connectivity; Rainfall-runoff process; Scaling effects; Understory vegetation,Catchments; Forestry; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Infiltration; Rain; Spatial distribution; Storms; Vegetation; Flow path; Hydrological connectivity; Rainfall-runoff process; Scaling effects; Understory vegetation; Runoff; ground water; rain; computer simulation; flow field; forested catchment; groundwater-surface water interaction; headwater; hydrological regime; infiltration; numerical model; rainfall-runoff modeling; runoff; spatial distribution; stormwater; understory; Article; bioavailability; canopy; catchment; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; hydrology; Japan; priority journal; process model; runoff; vegetation; water flow; Japan; Hortonia,"Gomi, T.; Department of International Environmental and Agricultural Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 3-5-8, Saiwaie, Japan; email: gomit@cc.tuat.ac.jp",,Elsevier B.V.,489697,,STEVA,30878923,English,Sci.

The paper presents an assessment of fire-related and wind-induced forest losses in the Ural region of Russia for 2000‒2014. The assessment is based on the use of Landsat images, Global Forest Change dataset (Hansen et al. in Science 342:850–853, 2013. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1244693) and other space imagery data. The total area of stand-replacement fires and windthrows in the Ural’s forests was estimated at 1.637 million ha, which is 1.56% of the total forest-covered area. The contribution of wildfires and windthrows is 96.4% and 3.6%, respectively. The highest frequency of large-scale wildfires was observed behind the Northern Ural ridge, where the fire scars of 2000‒2014 covered 10–14% of the forested area. The storm-related forest damage is significant only on the western part of the Ural. A few catastrophic wildfires and windthrows (with an area > 5000 ha) make up 35% of the entire damaged area. The number of wildfires, windthrows and their damaged area vary significantly from year to year. For 2000–2014, it is impossible to find a statistically significant trend of the fire- and storm-damaged area. The seasonal maximum of large-scale wildfires and windthrows was observed in July. Also, we identified the statistically significant relationships of fire- and wind-related forest damage with environmental variables. The occurrence of large-scale wildfires is related mainly to the species composition of forests, and also to the altitude, the mean annual precipitation and the population density. The spatial distribution of massive windthrows has a strong correlation with the species composition of forests, the mean annual precipitation and partially with the wind effect parameter. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Forest fires; Global Forest Change data; Landsat images; Long-term data series; Spatio-temporal distribution; Ural region; Windthrows,community composition; environmental disturbance; forest fire; Landsat; satellite data; spatial distribution; storm; temporal distribution; windthrow; Urals,"Shikhov, A.N.; Perm State UniversityRussian Federation; email: shikhovan@gmail.com",,Springer Netherlands,0921030X,,,,English,Nat.

Therefore, foresters need forest management strategies to reduce the damage risk. This paper focused on the damage patterns within the forest as the final results of multiple tree-wind dynamic interactions in time and space during a storm. Recent developments in computer technology allow for the possibility of simulating the complex and dynamic phenomena of damage during a storm but are extremely time consuming. To simplify the simulations without losing the crucial aspects of wind damage in forests, we introduced a computer simulation model using the agent-based modelling (ABM) technique, which capture the phenomena and interactions of individuals called ‘agents’. We created an ABM for forest wind damage simulation, coupling together an accepted understanding of wind gusts in forests, tree bending moments, and damage propagation. The model was tested with variations in three conditions: trees acclimated and unacclimated to their wind environment; three levels of gust strength; and three tree planting densities. The ABM was able to replicate damage patterns and demonstrate damage propagation within the forest and the effects of forest edges. The difference in the rate of damage in the forest between acclimated and unacclimated edges became similar with an increase in the gust intensity, and a decrease in tree density through a reduction in the shelter effect of the forest. The ABM could be improved in the future by parametrizing the variation in individual tree resistance, and the variation in gust and wind strength, as well as adding more information on local environmental conditions such as topography and soil variation, and storm characteristics such as duration and intensity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based model; Damage pattern; Damage propagation; Forest edge; Gust; Wind damage,agrometeorology; biomechanics; computer simulation; environmental disturbance; environmental stress; forest ecosystem; forest edge; gust; storm surge; wind forcing,"Kamimura, K.; School of Science and Technology, Shinshu University, 8304 Minamiminowa, Kamiina, Japan; email: kamimura@shinshu-u.ac.jp",,Elsevier B.V.,1681923,,AFMEE,,English,Agric.

One common strategy to facilitate these goals is to seed fast-growing legumes combined with one application of P-fertiliser to maximise legume growth and increase soil-N. However, the longer term effects of this strategy have received little attention. Here we report the results of a 15-year-old experiment that was established to test the effects of fertiliser-P application and seeding large understorey legumes, both singly and in combination, on jarrah forest restoration after bauxite mining. Fifteen years after the establishment of this experiment, the majority of the seeded legumes had senesced, with total legume cover having declined significantly compared with results of the same experiment at 5-years-of-age. Yet, despite the legumes having senesced there were still negative effects of both large legumes and P-fertiliser on species richness and abundance of non-leguminous understorey species. These negative effects may be mediated by the persistent effects of legume competition that was evident at 5 years and the accumulation of significant quantities of leaf litter and fine woody debris in the large legume × P-addition treatments. Compared with the 0 kg P ha −1 treatment, application of 20 kg P ha −1 significantly increased jarrah tree growth, but there was no additional benefit of 80 kg P ha −1 . These data suggest that moderation of P-fertiliser and large understorey legumes could maximise understorey cover, tree growth and understorey species richness, and therefore simultaneously address multiple key restoration goals. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Acacia; Competition; Fertilizer; Nitrogen; Rehabilitation,Bauxite deposits; Competition; Fertilizers; Forestry; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nutrients; Patient rehabilitation; Phosphorus; Restoration; Acacia; Common strategy; Fine woody debris; Mine restorations; Mining process; Nutrient cycling; Re-establishing; Species richness; Conservation; bauxite; competition (ecology); environmental restoration; experiment; fertilizer application; leaf litter; legume; mine; mining; nitrogen; phosphorus; remediation; species richness; woody debris; Competition; Fertilizers; Forestry; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Acacia; Eucalyptus marginata,"Daws, M.I.; Environment Department, Alcoa of Australia Ltd, Huntly Mine, PO Box 172, Australia; email: m.i.daws@reading.ac.uk",,Elsevier B.V.,3781127,,FECMD,,English,For.

We analyzed sediment profiles covering the past ~10,000 years from three lakes associated with an iron blast furnace in central Sweden, as an example of the many small-scale furnaces with historical roots in the medieval period. With a focus on long-term lake-water quality, we analyzed multiple proxies including geochemistry, pollen and charcoal, diatom composition and inferred pH, biogenic silica (bSi), visible near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS)-inferred lake-water total organic carbon (LW-TOC), and VNIRS-inferred sediment chlorophyll (sed-Chl). All three lakes had stable conditions during the middle Holocene (~5000 BCE to 1110 CE) typical of oligo-dystrophic lakes: pH 5.4–5.6, LW-TOC 15–18 mg L −1 . The most important diatom taxa include, for example, Aulacoseira scalaris, Brachysira neoexilis, and Frustulia saxonica. From ~1150 CE, decreases in LW-TOC, bSi, and sed-Chl in all three lakes coincide with a suite of proxies indicating disturbance associated with local, small-scale agriculture, and the more widespread use of the landscape in the past (e.g. forest grazing, charcoal production). Most important was a decline in LW-TOC by 30–50% in the three lakes prior to the 20th century. In addition, the one lake (Fickeln) downstream of the smelter and main areas of cultivation experienced a shift in diatom composition (mainly increasing Asterionella formosa) and a 0.6 pH increase coinciding with increasing cereal pollen and signs of blast furnace activity. The pH did not change in the other two lakes in response to disturbance; however, these lakes show a slight increase (0.3–0.5 pH units) because of modern liming. LW-TOC has returned to background levels in the downstream lake and remains lower in the other two. © The Author(s) 2019.",diatoms; environmental change; geochemistry; human impacts; lake-water carbon; sediment; total organic carbon,anthropogenic effect; boreal forest; chlorophyll; diatom; environmental change; environmental impact; geochemistry; historical record; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; lake water; Medieval; metallurgy; microcosm; mining; smelting; total organic carbon; water quality; Sweden; Asterionella formosa; Aulacoseira; Bacillariophyta; Brachysira; Frustulia saxonica,"Myrstener, E.; Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, Umeå UniversitySweden; email: erik.myrstener@gmail.com",,SAGE Publications Ltd,9596836,,HOLOE,,English,Holocene,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061205652

One of the well-studied mechanisms by which forest wind and fire disturbances interact is that wind damage increases flammable fuels—amplifying the effects of fire—leading to unexpected changes in vegetation composition. However, wind disturbance may also buffer the effects of fire through mechanisms such as disrupting fuel continuity. The extent to which wind and fire disturbances buffer, or reduce, the magnitude of ecological change has been less well studied. In this study, we winched trees in a Pinus taeda L. forest to simulate wind damage in experimental plots and combined this treatment with prescribed fire. This design allowed investigation of how forest regeneration responds to combinations of wind and fire disturbance, with particular emphasis on whether disturbance interactions were amplifying or buffering. We also tested for evidence of two mechanisms of disturbance interaction that are expected to buffer the cumulative ecological impact of wind and fire disturbances, testing (1) whether wind damage increased resprouting response following fire and (2) whether seedlings on tip-up mounds were protected from fire. We identified evidence for a combination of disturbance interactions occurring in both an amplifying direction (e.g., rapid recruitment and establishment of Rhus copallinum) as well as interactions occurring in a buffering direction (e.g., increased resilience in resprouting saplings in winched plots). Such varying responses may lead to a heterogeneous mixture of amplifying and buffering effects following compounded disturbances, such that at the stand scale, the aggregate regeneration response of two disturbances is the net effect of these individual interaction mechanisms. The results of this study highlight that mechanisms of disturbance interactions may vary spatially and temporally and may be best understood by considering factors such as disturbance severity, species life history traits, and timing between disturbances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Amplifying effects; Antagonism; Buffering effects; Disturbance interactions; Prescribed fire; Synergism; Tornado; Wind damage,Ecology; Reforestation; Tornadoes; Amplifying effect; Antagonism; Buffering effect; Prescribed fires; Synergism; Wind damage; Fires; aggregate; antagonism; buffering; ecological impact; life history trait; prescribed burning; resprouting; tornado; Damage; Ecology; Fires; Impact; Reforestation; Synergism; Trees; Wind; Pinus taeda; Rhus copallinum,"Cannon, J.B.; Colorado Forest Restoration Institute, Department of Forest and Rangeland Stewardship, Colorado State University, 1472 Campus Delivery, United States; email: jbcannon.pubs@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,3781127,,FECMD,,English,For.

We used remote-sensing datasets to characterize the past and future topographic impacts of surface coal mining on the mixed-mesophytic forests of eastern Kentucky. To provide context, we examined the consequences of widespread topographic rearrangement for an imperiled ridgetop-associated predator, the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus). We found that surface mining disproportionately impacts ridgetop habitats, causing large reductions in suitable habitat for C horridus, and most likely other ridgetop-dependent biota as well. Land permitted for surface mining is also concentrated in high topographic positions, and patterns of habitat loss are therefore likely to remain concentrated within these ecosystems.

We collected the corrosion data of 17 low alloy steels under 6 atmospheric corrosion test stations in China over 16 years as the experimental datasets. Based on the datasets, a Random Forests model is established to implement the purpose of the corrosion rate prediction and data-mining. The results showed that the random forests can achieve the best generalization results compared to the commonly used machine learning methods such as the artificial neural network, support vector regression, and logistic regression. In addition, the results also showed that regarding the effect to the corrosion rate, environmental factors contributed more than chemical compositions in the low alloy steels, but as exposure time increases, the effect of the environmental factors will gradually become less. Furthermore, we give the effect changes of six environmental factors (Cl?? concentration, SO 2 concentration, relative humidity, temperature, rainfall, and pH) on corrosion with exposure time increasing, and the results illustrated that pH had a significant contribution to the corrosion of the entire process. The paper also dealt with the problem of the corrosion rate forecast, especially for changing environmental factors situations, and obtained the qualitative and quantitative results of influences of each environmental factor on corrosion. © 2019 by the authors.

To explore potential synergies between edge effects, fire and windstorm damage as causes of Amazonian forest degradation, we quantified vegetation responses to a 30-min, high-intensity windstorm that in 2012, swept through a large-scale fire experiment that borders an agricultural field. Our pre- and postwindstorm measurements include tree mortality rates and modes of death, above-ground biomass, and airborne LiDAR-based estimates of tree heights and canopy disturbance (i.e., number and size of gaps). The experimental area in the southeastern Amazonia includes three 50-ha plots established in 2004 that were unburned (Control), burned annually (B1yr), or burned at 3-year intervals (B3yr). The windstorm caused greater damage to trees (>10 cm DBH) in the burned plots (B1yr: 13 ± 9% of 785 trees; B3yr: 17 ± 13% of 433) than in the Control plot (8 ± 4% of 2,300; ± CI). It substantially reduced vegetation height by 14% in B1yr, 20% in B3yr and 12% in the Control plots, while it reduced above-ground biomass by 18% of 77.7 Mg/ha (B1yr), 31% of 56.6 (B3yr), and 15% of 120 (Control). Tree damage was greatest near the agricultural field edge in all three plots, especially among large trees and in B3yr. Trunk snapping (70%) and uprooting (20%) were the most common modes of tree damage and mortality, with the height of trunk failure on the burned plots often corresponding with the height of historical fire scars. Of the windstorm-damaged trees, 80% (B1yr), 90% (B3yr), and 57% (Control) were dead 4 years later. Trees that had crown damage experienced the least mortality (22%–60%), followed by those that were snapped (55%–94%) and uprooted (88%–94%). Synthesis. We demonstrate the synergistic effects of three kinds of disturbances on a tropical forest. Our results show that the effects of windstorms are exacerbated by prior degradation by fire and fragmentation. We highlight that understorey fires can produce long-lasting effects on tropical forests not only by directly killing trees but also by increasing tree vulnerability to wind damage due to fire scars and a more open canopy. © 2018 The Authors.

We used a set of ten, 0.4-ha plots established in 1935 and measured every 5-13 years to examine the cumulative effects of multiple wind disturbance events in the coastal forests of Oregon. Since 1935 there have been ten documented wind events in coastal Oregon with hurricane-force winds. Most of the eight windstorms since 1962 noticeably influenced at least one plot; however, no individual storm clearly influenced all plots. Net rate of biomass accumulation of plots was negative when biomass mortality exceeded 29-41 Mg/ha per 5-year period (or 3.4%-5.8% per 5 years). In contrast, wind disturbance did not clearly reduce NPP (Net Primary Production) in any plot until biomass mortality exceeded 50%. Major wind-related mortality episodes in individual plots did not necessarily strongly influence the average loss of biomass across all plots. For example, a biomass loss of 88% in one plot resulted in an average loss of only 3.4% across all plots. In contrast, the cumulative effect of multiple plots with repeated wind-related mortality did decrease biomass at the multi-plot level. Depending on the plot, wind caused 16%-59% of the total mortality over time, and the proportion of wind-related mortality has increased 5- to 8-fold since 1940. The majority (80%) of wind-related mortality was ""immediate"", but some trees survived up to 35 years after being significantly wind damaged. Despite western hemlock having a wind-related mortality rate that was at least twice that of Sitka spruce, the number of stems of the former species increased over time. This trend may be related to the predominant recovery mechanism which was the release of existing small trees and the fact that the majority of ingrowth was western hemlock. This study suggests that wind disturbance is a heterogeneous, gradual process and that while individual events have a detectable impact on structure and function, the largest impacts, at least in systems where it reoccurs each decade, are cumulative. © 2019 by the authors.",Cumulative effects; Disturbance; Forest regeneration; Long-term change; Mortality; Permanent plots; Windthrow,Biomass; Reforestation; Storms; Cumulative effects; Disturbance; Forest regeneration; Long term change; Mortality; Permanent plot; Windthrows; Population statistics; coniferous forest; disturbance; environmental factor; long-term change; mixed forest; mortality; net primary production; regeneration; wind field; Biomass; Mortality; Oregon; Picea Sitchensis; Reforestation; Trees; Tsuga Heterophylla; Wind; Oregon; United States; Picea sitchensis; Tsuga heterophylla,"Harmon, M.E.; Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State UniversityUnited States; email: mark.harmon@oregonstate.edu",,MDPI AG,19994907,,,,English,Forests,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061280164

The study area consists of 4 open pit mines surrounded by forestry area located in the Antalya province which is nearby the Mediterranean Sea known as one of the most popular holiday destinations in Turkey. Opposite to the expansion of the mine areas forestry area decreases in this region. To quantify the decrease in the forestry area multi-temporal satellite imageries were used for 4 open pit mines. Used data were Spot 5 and Spot 6 satellite images with spatial resolution of 5 m and 6 m respectively. Spatial change was determined by applying object-based classification method for all satellite images. Accuracy analyses were made by means of overall accuracy and kappa statistic values. The overall accuracy values of the classified imageries of 2011, 2014 and 2017 were respectively 94.81%, 94.0% and 97.1% with the kappa statistical values of 0.9212, 0.9070 and 0.9538. According to the results of these classifications, the area values covered by the mines in the study area were respectively 55.06, 77.02 and 103.10 hectares in 2011, 2014 and 2017. Additionally, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used in one of the mine areas in order to realistic evaluation of an area by using orthophotos. Two orthophotos with the pixel sizes of 4 cm and 7 cm were produced from multi-temporal aerial photographs. As a result of the study, it can be said that remotely sensed imageries are the main data to temporal follow-up of the mine areas. In this context, UAVs have been shown to be a better option for monitoring the environmental effects of mining areas when criteria such as acquisition of the data, accuracy, speed and time are evaluated.

The area known as El Oro-Tlalpujahua Mining District in central Mexico was subjected to significant environmental impacts as a result of ore extraction, including profound habitat transformations, landscape changes, and the accumulation of potentially toxic elements in their tailings (favoring its bioavailability and dispersion). After more than 60 years without extractive activities, there is no knowledge on extant remaining impacts on biological communities. Assuming the presence of negative impacts on birds, we compared the composition and abundance of bird communities in two locations, representing a site without exposure to tailings (S1) and another one with tailings deposition (S2). From June 2014 to June 2015, we recorded 2828 individuals of 108 avian species in 369 point counts (S1 = 91, S2 = 95). The Chao1 indicator suggested we recorded 96% of the species present. We found a high similarity in the general composition and abundance of bird species between communities (&gt; 85%). However, there were significant differences in the abundances of 18 species (9 of them higher in the control site); these differences might result from differential effects of potentially toxic elements on functional groups (such as feeding guilds), resource availability, as well as other factors not accounted for. Historically, mining activities in the area generated significant changes in the structure and composition of the forest, and disrupted ecological processes. Despite the fact that current conditions appear favorable to the relative stability of the bird community, specific physiological effects on some species of birds sixty years after the cessation of mineral extraction could occur. Further studies on physiological performance and the effects of potentially toxic elements on local birds could unveil unknown effects at the individual level. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

In 1998, an ice storm damaged forest canopies and led to increased hydrologic losses of nitrogen (N) from the northern hardwood forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), a Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in New Hampshire, USA. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying this response, we experimentally simulated ice storms with different frequencies and severities at the small plot scale. We took measurements of plant and soil variables before (2015) and after (2016, 2017) treatments using the same methods used in 1998 with a focus on hydrologic and gaseous losses of reactive N, as well as rates of soil N cycle processes. Nitrogen cycle responses to the treatments were insignificant and less marked than the responses to the 1998 natural ice storm. Pools and leaching of inorganic N, net and gross mineralization and nitrification and denitrification rates, and soil to atmosphere fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) were unaffected by the treatments, in contrast to the 1998 storm which caused marked increases in leaching and watershed export of inorganic N. The difference in response may be a manifestation of N oligotrophication that has occurred at the HBEF over the past 30 years. Results suggest that ecosystem response to disturbances, such as ice storms, is changing due to aspects of global environmental change, challenging our ability to understand and predict the effects of these events on ecosystem structure, function, and services. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",climate change; denitrification; disturbance; mineralization; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nitrous oxide,,"Weitzman, J.N.; City University of New York Advanced Science Research Center at the Graduate CenterUnited States; email: WeitzmanJ@caryinstitute.org",,Springer,14329840,,ECOSF,,English,Ecosystems,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075462400

However, there have been few long-term studies of the recovery of these systems following wind damage. Long-term studies of protected forest systems, such as Dinsmore Woods in Northern Kentucky, within the fragmented forest of this region are valuable as they provide a resource to document and understand the effect of both abiotic and biotic challenges to forest systems. This study is a 40-year analysis of both overstory and understory changes in the forest system at DinsmoreWoods as the result of damage caused by severe winds in the spring of 1974. The forest was surveyed before and immediately following the windstorm and then at 10-year intervals. Although the windstorm had an immediate effect on the forest, the pattern of damage was complex. The forest canopy (diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 30 cm) experienced an irregular pattern of damage while in the subcanopy (DBH ≤ 30 cm) there was a 25% reduction in total basal area. However, the major effects of the windstorm were delayed and subsequently have altered forest recovery. Ten years following the disturbance declines were seen in total density and basal area in the canopy and subcanopy of the forest as a consequence of windstorm damage. In the past 20 years the total basal area of the canopy has increased and exceeds the pre-disturbance total basal area. In contrast, the subcanopy total basal area continued to decline 20 years post-disturbance and has not recovered. Further openings in the canopy and subcanopy due to the delayed windstorm effects helped to establish a dense understory of native shrubs and sugar maple which have affected tree regeneration and is reflected in the continual decline in species diversity in the subcanopy and sapling strata over the 40-year period. © 2019 by the authors.",Forest recovery and regeneration; Kentucky; Old-growth forest; Overstory and understory changes; Windstorm damage,Recovery; Forest recovery; Kentucky; Old-growth forest; Overstory and understory changes; Windstorm damage; Reforestation; climate change; environmental disturbance; forest canopy; old-growth forest; overstory; population decline; regeneration; severe weather; understory; wind velocity; Basal Area; Damage; Kentucky; Patterns; Recovery; Reforestation; Systems; Wind; Kentucky; United States; Acer saccharum,"Held, M.E.; Department of Biology, Saint Peter's University, NJ, United States; email: mheld@saintpeters.edu",,MDPI AG,19994907,,,,English,Forests,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063860986

However, on the other hand, mining activities will lead to land degradation. The mining site needs major attention due to environmental damage caused. In addition to causing erosion and sedimentation, mining activities can lead to increase of heavy metal content in soils potentially entering the aquatic environment, decreasing the quantity and quality of water. Therefore, a repair or rehabilitation effort on post mining land is needed so as not to cause sustained damage.

Artisanal-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a large cause of this deforestation and brings with it extensive environmental, social, governance, and public health impacts, including large carbon emissions and mercury pollution. Underlying ASGM is a broad network of factors that influence its growth, distribution, and practices such as poverty, flows of legal and illegal capital, conflicting governance, and global economic trends. Despite its central role in land use and land cover change in the Western Amazon and the severity of its social and environmental impacts, it is relatively poorly studied. While ASGM in Southeastern Peru has been quantified previously, doing so is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of the resulting landscape. Using a novel approach to classify mining that relies on a fusion of CLASlite and the Global Forest Change dataset, two Landsat-based deforestation detection tools, we sought to quantify ASGM-caused deforestation in the period 1984-2017 in the southern Peruvian Amazon and examine trends in the geography, methods, and impacts of ASGM across that time. We identify nearly 100,000 ha of deforestation due to ASGM in the 34-year study period, an increase of 21% compared to previous estimates. Further, we find that 10% of that deforestation occurred in 2017, the highest annual amount of deforestation in the study period, with 53% occurring since 2011. Finally, we demonstrate that not all mining is created equal by examining key patterns and changes in ASGM activity and techniques through time and space. We discuss their connections with, and impacts on, socio-economic factors, such as land tenure, infrastructure, international markets, governance efforts, and social and environmental impacts. © 2018 by the authors.",Artisanal-scale gold mining; Commodity; Infrastructure; Landsat; Protected areas,Classification (of information); Conservation; Deforestation; Economic and social effects; Economic geology; Gold mines; International trade; Land use; Commodity; Gold mining; Infrastructure; LANDSAT; Protected areas; Environmental impact,"Messinger, M.; Center for Energy, Environment, and Sustainability, Wake Forest University, 1834 Wake Forest Rd, United States; email: messmc9@wfu.edu",,MDPI AG,20724292,,,,English,Remote Sens.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058879365

Soil processes such as the recycling of organic matter, energy and nutrients are controlled by soil fauna. However, little is still known about the post-disturbance recovery of soil microarthropod communities in forest stands exposed to windthrow of various severity and post-windthrow forest management over time. This study assessed soil Collembola community recovery in pine forest stands over the long-term (between 9 and 14 years after the disturbance event). We predicted that (1) different severity of windthrow disturbance in a pine forest has different effects on the recovery of Collembola community composition and functional structure, even after 10 years; (2) The recovery of Collembola communities is similar during regeneration of a forest disturbed by windthrow and in a pine plantation planted after clearing of a windthrown forest and subsequent soil preparation; (3) The changes in the Collembola community during forest regeneration after windthrow disturbance can be explained by selected environmental variables, especially the leaf area index LAI. As expected, regeneration processes within forest stands shifted the species composition of collembolan communities and changed their functional structure. The surface dwelling collembolan species (epigeic and atmobiotic life form) responded to regeneration processes mainly in pine stands, especially in a pine plantation established after a clearing of broken pines and subsequent soil preparation. Our results suggest different sensitivity of collembolan communities to environmental changes induced by various degrees of opening of the tree canopy by windthrow and to those caused by the post disturbance treatment. These findings confirm that collembolan community composition recovery is slow and divergent during natural regeneration of pine stands and regeneration by planting but does not differ between moderately and severely successional trajectories. Our results also confirm the importance of canopy closure for the possibility of Collembola community regeneration. If canopies were more closed (higher leaf area index, LAI index), the possibility of regeneration increased, especially in the young pine plantations, as seen in the final years of our study. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Disturbances; Forest ecosystems; Functional traits; IndVal; LAI index; Principal response curve PRC; Succession,Animals; Ecosystems; Recovery; Soils; Disturbances; Forest ecosystem; Functional traits; IndVal; LAI index; Response curves; Succession; Reforestation; arthropod; community composition; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; disturbance; environmental change; forest canopy; forest management; leaf area index; plantation forestry; soil fauna; soil organic matter; stand structure; succession; windthrow; Animals; Ecosystems; Natural Reforestation; Pinus; Processes; Recovery; Soil; Collembola; Hexapoda,"Skłodowski, J.; Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Department of Forest Protection and Ecology, Nowoursynowska 159, Poland; email: jsklodowski@wl.sggw.pl",,Elsevier B.V.,3781127,,FECMD,,English,For.

We investigated filters through a long-term study examining reptile and mammal recolonization of, and population persistence in, post-mining restoration in the northern jarrah forest of southwestern Australia. Neither mammal community composition, nor individual mammal species, differed between unmined forest and restoration but reptile communities did and some reptile species were significantly less abundant in restoration than in unmined forest. We concluded that there were no filters to mammal recolonization and persistence but that there were both unidirectional (decreasing gradually over time) and dynamic (fluctuating over time) filters to reptile recolonization of post-mining restoration that influenced both recolonization and population persistence of some reptile species. Low volumes of coarse woody debris appeared to be a unidirectional filter that will slow recolonization by some reptile species for decades or even centuries. Canopy cover appeared to be a dynamic filter that fluctuated over a period of >7 years and precluded population persistence of some reptile species that had already recolonized the post-mining restoration. A dearth of studies made it difficult to generalize how widespread these filters were in restoration areas but studies of thinning and burning in natural forests suggested they were likely to be widespread. Although management techniques to reduce the effect of unidirectional and dynamic filters remain poorly developed, their development and adoption will improve the ability of restoration to facilitate fauna recolonization and persistence and better contribute towards biodiversity conservation. © 2018 Ecological Society of Australia",biodiversity; conservation; eucalypt; long-term; mammal; management; reptile; succession,biodiversity; community composition; conservation management; environmental factor; environmental restoration; evergreen forest; fauna; long-term change; longevity; mammal; recolonization; reptile; restoration ecology; succession; temporal analysis; Australia; Jarrah Forest; Western Australia; Eucalyptus marginata; Mammalia; Reptilia,"Craig, M.D.; Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions, School of Biological Sciences, University of Western AustraliaAustralia; email: M.Craig@murdoch.edu.au",,Blackwell Publishing,14429985,,AUECF,,English,Austral Ecol.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050857145

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) produces detailed 3D maps of forest canopy structure from which aboveground carbon density can be estimated. Working with a ALS dataset collected over the 8049-km2 Wellington Region of New Zealand we create maps of indigenous forest carbon and evaluate the influence of wind by examining how carbon storage varies with aspect. Storms flowing from the west are a common cause of disturbance in this region, and we hypothesised that west-facing forests exposed to these winds would be shorter than those in sheltered east-facing sites. Methods: The aboveground carbon density of 31 forest inventory plots located within the ALS survey region were used to develop estimation models relating carbon density to ALS information. Power-law models using rasters of top-of-the-canopy height were compared with models using tree-level information extracted from the ALS dataset. A forest carbon map with spatial resolution of 25 m was generated from ALS maps of forest height and the estimation models. The map was used to evaluate the influences of wind on forests. Results: Power-law models were slightly less accurate than tree-centric models (RMSE 35% vs 32%) but were selected for map generation for computational efficiency. The carbon map comprised 4.5 million natural forest pixels within which canopy height had been measured by ALS, providing an unprecedented dataset with which to examine drivers of carbon density. Forests facing in the direction of westerly storms stored less carbon, as hypothesised. They had much greater above-ground carbon density for a given height than any of 14 tropical forests previously analysed by the same approach, and had exceptionally high basal areas for their height. We speculate that strong winds have kept forests short without impeding basal area growth. Conclusion: Simple estimation models based on top-of-the canopy height are almost as accurate as state-of-the-art tree-centric approaches, which require more computing power. High-resolution carbon maps produced by ALS provide powerful datasets for evaluating the environmental drivers of forest structure, such as wind. © 2017, The Author(s).",Airborne laser scanning; Carbon; Climate change; Cyclone; Forest; LiDAR; LUCAS; New Zealand; Remote sensing; Wind,,"Coomes, D.A.; Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, United Kingdom; email: dac18@cam.ac.uk",,SpringerOpen,20956355,,,,English,For.

The study sites were 31 small heaps of waste rock covered by an 80–120 year old beech forest. The sites were described in terms of plant coverage, species richness and composition, and the composition of plant traits. Three types of understory communities that were identified were compared for environmental variables and plant parameters. Despite a high concentration of heavy metals in soils, namely Cd, Pb, and Zn, the degree of shading by the tree canopy was the main factor determining variation in understory communities. The understories that developed in low and strong shading were similar to some extent: They had high number of species, and they were characterized by a high proportion of the ancient forest species. The species composition changed substantially with increasing coverage of trees; mixed strategy plants withdrew, while the stress tolerant species became more abundant. The other predictor of community structure was the ratio of Cd to Ca, which was responsible for the decrease of woody plants and the endangered species. This study proved that, in the case of highly complex and productive ecosystems, even with a high degree of contamination with heavy metals, the biotic factors play a primary role. © 2018",Beech forests understory vegetation; Heavy metal; Historical mining; Species composition; Species diversity; Species traits,"cadmium; calcium; lead; zinc; heavy metal; lead; zinc; community structure; concentration (composition); deciduous forest; lead; mining; pollution effect; species diversity; vegetation dynamics; zinc; Article; beech forest; controlled study; environmental impact; forest; habitat; mining; plant parameters; soil analysis; soil chemistry; species composition; species diversity; vegetation dynamics; analysis; beech; chemistry; ecosystem; pH; Poland; soil; soil pollutant; tree; Poland [Central Europe]; Fagus; Ecosystem; Fagus; Forests; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Mining; Poland; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Trees; Zinc",,,Academic Press,1476513,,EESAD,30170317,English,Ecotoxicol.

Litterfall showed homogeneous Δ199Hg values [-0.18 ± 0.05‰, i.e., a modern gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) isotopic signature]. After litter decomposition, Hg bound to organic matter (OM) is mixed with Hg from pristine (-0.55 ± 0.22‰) or gold-mined (-0.09 ± 0.16‰) mineral materials. Negative Δ199Hg values in deep pristine mineral horizons (-0.60 ± 0.16‰) suggest the transfer of Hg bound to dissolved OM depleted in odd isotopes due to mass-independent fractionation during Hg abiotic reduction. Perennial palm tree leaves collected above gold-mined and pristine soil recorded contrasting Δ199Hg signatures likely resulting from GEM re-emission processes from soils and leaf surfaces. Upslope, soil δ202Hg signatures showed a negative shift (ϵ ∼-1‰) with depth attributed to mass-dependent fractionation during Hg sorption and complexation onto iron oxides and dissolved OM. Downslope, higher δ202Hg values in soils resulted from hydromorphy [lower humification, greater Hg(II) reduction, etc.]. The unique Hg isotopic signatures of Amazonian soils probably result in multistep fractionation processes during pedogenesis (millions of years) and in a potentially different Hg isotopic signature of preanthropogenic background GEM. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,Economic geology; Iron oxides; Isotopes; Soil pollution; Soils; Tropics; Abiotic reduction; Fractionation process; Isotopic fractionations; Isotopic signatures; Litter decomposition; Mass-independent fractionation; Mineral materials; Tropical forest soils; Mercury compounds; gold; iron oxide; mercury; gold; catena; complexation; forest soil; gold; isotopic fractionation; mercury (element); mining; pedogenesis; tropical forest; Article; bioturbation; canopy; combustion; complex formation; controlled study; forest soil; fractionation; French Guiana; isotope analysis; litter decomposition; mining; pedogenesis (soil); tropical rain forest; environmental monitoring; forest; mining; soil; Amazonia; French Guiana; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; French Guiana; Gold; Mercury; Mercury Isotopes; Mining; Soil,"Guédron, S.; Univ.

In order to close this knowledge gap, we took advantage of a tornado event, which occurred in July 2012 in Trzebciny Forest District in northwest Poland. The main objective of this study was to determine how two completely different reforestation techniques in windthrow areas impact net ecosystem production (NEP) of this Scots pine forest ecosystem under similar meteorological conditions. The two techniques were: conventional (“Tlen I” site): uprooted stumps pulled out and removed from the site followed by ploughing, and non-conventional (“Tlen II” site): all stumps left on the site to decompose with no ploughing. Therefore, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes using the eddy covariance (EC) technique for four continuous years. Our results indicate that both sites became significant carbon (C) sources after the windthrow (up to 575 ± 56 g C m−2 y-1 in the first year, Tlen I). However, the Tlen I (conventional technique) lost over 30% less C than Tlen II during the 2015–2016 observation period. In contrast to existing knowledge, ploughing as done at Tlen I, did not substantially increase CO2 emission, as compared to local soil ripping (non-conventional technique). The decrease in net C emission, estimated on the basis of linear model parameters, was almost five times greater at Tlen I than at Tlen II. We thus hypothesize that the annual NEP at conventionally reforested windthrow site will reach C neutrality (NEP = 0) six years after windthrow at most, while at the non-conventionally managed area it will probably take ca. 18 years. So far then, the currently widely applied conventional reforestation technique in wind-disturbed Polish forest appeared to be more effective in decreasing C losses than a technique that leaves stumps to decompose and avoids ploughing. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Eddy covariance; Meteorological extremes; Net ecosystem exchange; Net ecosystem productivity,carbon balance; climate conditions; comparative study; coniferous forest; eddy covariance; environmental disturbance; extreme event; forest ecosystem; net ecosystem exchange; net ecosystem production; reforestation; tornado; windthrow; Poland [Central Europe]; Pinus sylvestris,"Ziemblińska, K.; Department of Meteorology, Poznań University of Life Sciences, Piątkowska 94, Poland; email: klaudiaziemblinska@up.poznan.pl",,Elsevier B.V.,1681923,,AFMEE,,English,Agric.

Saltmarshes are under threat from sea level rise, landward migration of mangroves, and in urban regions from habitat loss, input of litter, nutrients, and other contaminants. In urbanised catchments, saltmarsh areas receive nutrient-enriched and pollutant-contaminated run-off, such as heavy metals, through the stormwater system. This study aimed to investigate the impact of urban stormwater on saltmarsh and mangrove species composition and distribution. To test the effect of stormwater run-off in urbanised catchments on saltmarsh communities, we analysed the soil for pollutant elements, salinity and nutrient concentration and recorded vegetation composition at eight sites in the Sydney region, Australia. We found that elevated total nitrogen (>0.4 wt%) and reduced salinity of the soil downslope of stormwater outlets facilitates establishment of exotic plants and might promote migration of mangroves into saltmarshes, resulting in a squeezing effect on the distribution of saltmarsh vegetation. Saltmarsh cover was significantly lower below stormwater outlets and exotic plant cover increased significantly with sediment calcium concentrations above 8840 mg/kg, which are associated with stormwater run-off. However, this effect was found to be strongest in highly industrialised areas compared to residential areas. Understanding the impact of pollutants on coastal wetlands will improve management strategies for the conservation of this important endangered ecological community. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Exotic plants; Heavy metals; Intertidal wetlands; Mangrove encroachment; Nutrients; Pollution,Biodiversity; Catchments; Conservation; Ecosystems; Heavy metals; Nutrients; Pollution; Runoff; Sea level; Storms; Vegetation; Wetlands; Biodiversity conservation; Calcium concentration; Environment protection; Exotic plants; Intertidal wetland; Mangrove encroachment; Nutrient concentrations; Vegetation composition; Soil pollution; calcium; nitrogen; storm water; concentration (composition); freshwater environment; intertidal environment; mangrove; runoff; saltmarsh; stormwater; Article; Australia; catchment; controlled study; environmental impact; exotic species; freshwater environment; industrial area; mangrove; priority journal; residential area; runoff; salinity; salt marsh; sediment; soil pollutant; species composition; species distribution; urban area; vegetation; Rhizophoraceae,"Geedicke, I.; Macquarie University, Department of Biological SciencesAustralia; email: ina.geedicke@hdr.mq.edu.au",,Elsevier B.V.,489697,,STEVA,,English,Sci.

One of the concerns relates to increases in edge effects, which among other things affects the forest microclimate that influences the distribution and behavior of species. In Alberta, Canada, boreal anthropogenic disturbances from in situ oil exploration are increasing forest fragmentation, especially in the form of exploratory well pads and seismic lines (i.e., linear forest clearings created during the exploration phase of oil extraction). Dissection of these forests by seismic lines has the potential to change local patterns in wind and light, and thus may alter forest communities. Although alterations of these abiotic conditions are likely, the magnitude of these changes is unknown, particularly the effects of changes in the width and orientation of linear disturbances. Here we investigated changes in light and wind on seismic lines compared to that of adjacent undisturbed forests and nearby cleared openings. Specifically, we examined how seismic line characteristics (i.e., line direction, line width, and adjacent canopy height) altered local responses in these abiotic conditions. Generalized Linear Mixed Effect models predicted a 2-fold increase in average light intensity and maximum wind speeds, and a 4-fold increase in average wind speeds on seismic lines compared to adjacent forests. These changes did not approach the conditions in large openings, which compared to forests had a 3-fold increase in average light intensity, a 16-fold increase in average wind speeds, and a 4-fold increase in maximum wind speeds. Line width and orientation interacted with adjacent forest height altering the abiotic environment with wider lines having a 3-fold increase on maximum wind speed. We conclude that even localized, narrow ( < 10-m wide) forest disturbances associated with oil sands exploration alter forest microclimatic conditions. Recent changes in practices that reduce line width as well as promoting tree regeneration, will minimize the environmental effects of these anthropogenic disturbances. © 2018 by the authors.",Edge effects; Forest disturbance; Fragmentation; Linear features; Oil sands exploration; Seismic lines,Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Oil sands; Petroleum prospecting; Seismology; Speed; Wind; Edge effect; Forest disturbances; Fragmentation; Linear feature; Seismic lines; Reforestation; abiotic factor; boreal forest; environmental disturbance; light intensity; numerical model; wind velocity; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Fragmentation; Reforestation; Velocity; Wind; Alberta; Canada,"Stern, E.R.; Department of Renewable Resources, Faculty of Agriculture, Life and Environmental Sciences, University of AlbertaCanada; email: estern@ualberta.ca",,MDPI AG,19994907,,,,English,Forests,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054936442

Using tree demographic data from four large, tropical forest dynamics plots that differ in cyclonic storm frequency, we compare tree population and community dynamics. Additionally, we assess the effect of cyclonic storms on three functional traits, specific leaf area, wood density, and tree height of the dynamic tree assemblages. Mortality, growth and recruitment rates and the intrinsic rates of population growth of species differed across the plots, and were most dynamic, especially for stems 1-2 cm in diameter, at the plot which had an intermediate level of cyclonic storm frequency. Functional assemblages of species had the greatest degree of temporal variation in relation to disturbance, as measured by the change in functional divergence for the two plots with more intermediate cyclonic storm recurrence. Therefore, cyclonic storms affecting these plots generally have a greater effect on forest composition and dynamism than comparable cyclonic storms do on the plot which experiences cyclonic storms more frequently. Thus, we provide some evidence that community-wide demographic resistance to cyclonic storms is generally lower at an intermediate frequency of storms. While cyclonic storm strength and timing are important determinants of the within forest variation in tree dynamics and functional trait assemblages, we also show that cyclonic storm timing and frequency shapes tropical forest dynamics and functional composition across forests. We conclude that, over a given time interval, sites with intermediate levels of damaging cyclonic wind disturbance express a greater potential for life-history variation in the forest community, when compared to sites with less or more frequent disturbance. © 2018 by the authors.",Barro Colorado Island; Cyclonic wind disturbance; Forest demography; Forest resistance; Functional traits; Fushan; Hurricanes; Luquillo; Palanan; Tree growth; Tree mortality; Typhoons,Climate change; Dynamics; Hurricanes; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Storms; Tropics; Barro colorado islands; Forest demography; Functional traits; Fushan; Luquillo; Palanan; Tree growth; Tree mortality; Wind disturbance; Forestry; community dynamics; cyclone; demography; environmental disturbance; forest dynamics; hurricane; mortality; tree; tropical forest; typhoon; Dynamics; Forestry; Frequency; Sites; Time Measurement; Trees; Tropics; Wind; Barro Colorado Island; Panama Oeste; Panama [Central America],"Hogan, J.A.; Department of Biological Sciences, International Center for Tropical Botany, Florida International UniversityUnited States; email: jhogan@fiu.edu",,MDPI AG,19994907,,,,English,Forests,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049637014
