This study aims to develop a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to suggest a method for the proper installation of a wind monitoring system in a forested mountainous region. The inertial resistance coefficients of the canopy of coniferous and deciduous trees were measured through field experiments to simulate the wind environment in a mountainous region by considering the air resistance of trees. The averaged coefficients of the inertial resistance of coniferous and deciduous trees were 0.768 and 0.712 m-1, respectively. The developed open-source CFD model was validated using the measured field experiment data. The economic mesh size and a proper turbulence model were a 6.25 m and a standard k–ε turbulence model to simulate the wind environment in the selected forested mountainous region. Using the validated CFD model, the wind environments were analysed according to various environmental conditions, such as air resistance of trees, tree height, and diameter of the clear-cut, and a proper installation method for the mountain meteorological observation system to observe the wind was proposed based on the simulated results. © 2019 IAgrE","Complex terrain; Computational fluid dynamics; Mountainous terrain; Open-source CFD; Tree porosity","Computational fluid dynamics; Data handling; Forestry; Landforms; Turbulence models; Viruses; Weather information services; Complex terrains; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Environmental conditions; Installation methods; Meteorological observation; Mountainous terrain; Open sources; Resistance coefficients; Monitoring","Lee, I.-B.1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, South Korea; email: iblee@snu.ac.kr",,"Academic Press",15375110,,BEINB,,"English","Biosyst.

This study ascertained local communities’ perception of the importance of non-market ecosystem services, the impact of illegal mining on ecosystem services, and their likeliness to participate in restoration of degraded lands resulting from illegal mining. Fifty respondents each were purposefully selected from three mining communities (Ntakam, Asawinso No.1 and Nkatieso) in a survey. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests results indicated there were no difference in views of respondents regarding the importance of forest for various non-market services. Illegal mining activities were identified as the cause of environmental problems such as water pollution, deforestation, poor soil fertility and limited access to land for agriculture productivity. Majority of respondents across the three communities indicated that forest is very important for non-market environmental services. Logistic regression results indicated that factors that affect likeliness to participate in restoration financing included income, embracing non-market ecosystem services as important, confidence in PES schemes and positive value motivation for restoration (altruistic, use and bequest values). © 2019 The Author(s)","Community participation; Degraded mined sites; Ecosystem services; Ghana; Illegal mining; Restoration",,"Obeng, E.A.; CSIR-Forestry Research Institute of Ghana, P.O.

This research involved analysing soil disturbance from salvage logging in four mountain forests, managed with close-to-nature silviculture: the Hyrcanian forest (three forest compartments in Iran), using extraction by skidder, and the Camaldoli forest (one parcel in Italy), using extraction by tractor. The point transect method was used for assessing soil disturbance and also included further measurements of ruts’ size and selected physical soil parameters on skid trails after operation. After a windstorm, more than 94% and 17% of the area were undisturbed in the Hyrcanian and Camaldoli forests, respectively. Bulk density, penetration resistance, and pH did not show any significant differences with their average values specifically between disturbed and undisturbed soil after a windstorm. Related only to the effect of salvage logging, more than 80% of the area was undisturbed. The results were significantly lower in terms of the average values of soil variables such as bulk density, penetration resistance, and total porosity in disturbed soil than in undisturbed soil. For all the sites that were studied, bulk density and penetration resistance increased with the increasing number of machines that passes, while total porosity decreased. The results showed significant positive correlations between bulk density and penetration resistance, bulk density and pH value, and total porosity and pH value and significant negative correlations between bulk density and total porosity and penetration resistance and total porosity. The results indicated that the point transect method of assessing soil disturbance provides a rapid assessment of soil conditions for monitoring soil disturbance after salvage logging. Our results also indicated that to reduce impacts to soil during salvage logging, if the volume of windthrow timber is low, salvage logging is not always necessary because of the broad ecological importance as well as the economic aspects of dead wood in forest ecosystems. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","High forest; Salvage logging; Skidding; Soil disturbance; Windthrow","bulk density; climate effect; environmental disturbance; forest ecosystem; forestry production; logging (timber); silviculture; wind forcing; wind velocity; Iran; Italy","Picchio, R.; Department of Agriculture and Forest Sciences (DAFNE), Tuscia University, Via S.

High resolution LiDAR data were used to assess light availability to understory vegetation, which in turn was converted into an understory vegetation cover ratio. Spatially distributed infiltration capacities based on data from field rainfall-runoff experiments were incorporated into the TopoTube model using a relationship between infiltration capacity and vegetation cover. Effects of spatial distribution of infiltration capacity and its influence on hydrological connectivity and runoff processes were examined based on numerical simulations in the following three infiltration scenarios for seven natural storms: (1) spatially distributed infiltration capacity; (2) uniform infiltration capacity using the weighted mean of the spatial distribution in the drainage basin; and (3) uniform infiltration capacity using the arithmetic mean of field measurements. Although saturated subsurface flow dominated storm runoff in all simulations, Hortonian and saturated overland flow were significant for storm runoff response in smaller catchments (headwaters and zero-order basins). Simulations using spatially distributed infiltration capacities showed more Hortonian overland flow compared to using uniform infiltration because of areas with low infiltration located along channels. On the other hand, no differences in runoff were apparent between spatially-distributed and uniform infiltration scenarios in larger catchments. Our study also indicates that differences in contributions of subsurface and groundwater flow at the catchment scale need to be examined based on observations and simulations in nested catchments. Our findings suggest that including detailed patterns of vegetation ground cover are important for understanding hydrogeomorphic connectivity within catchments. © 2019","Flow path; Hydrological connectivity; Rainfall-runoff process; Scaling effects; Understory vegetation","Catchments; Forestry; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Infiltration; Rain; Spatial distribution; Storms; Vegetation; Flow path; Hydrological connectivity; Rainfall-runoff process; Scaling effects; Understory vegetation; Runoff; ground water; rain; computer simulation; flow field; forested catchment; groundwater-surface water interaction; headwater; hydrological regime; infiltration; numerical model; rainfall-runoff modeling; runoff; spatial distribution; stormwater; understory; Article; bioavailability; canopy; catchment; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; hydrology; Japan; priority journal; process model; runoff; vegetation; water flow; Japan; Hortonia","Gomi, T.; Department of International Environmental and Agricultural Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 3-5-8, Saiwaie, Japan; email: gomit@cc.tuat.ac.jp",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"30878923","English","Sci.

The paper presents an assessment of fire-related and wind-induced forest losses in the Ural region of Russia for 2000‒2014. The assessment is based on the use of Landsat images, Global Forest Change dataset (Hansen et al. in Science 342:850–853, 2013. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1244693) and other space imagery data. The total area of stand-replacement fires and windthrows in the Ural’s forests was estimated at 1.637 million ha, which is 1.56% of the total forest-covered area. The contribution of wildfires and windthrows is 96.4% and 3.6%, respectively. The highest frequency of large-scale wildfires was observed behind the Northern Ural ridge, where the fire scars of 2000‒2014 covered 10–14% of the forested area. The storm-related forest damage is significant only on the western part of the Ural. A few catastrophic wildfires and windthrows (with an area > 5000 ha) make up 35% of the entire damaged area. The number of wildfires, windthrows and their damaged area vary significantly from year to year. For 2000–2014, it is impossible to find a statistically significant trend of the fire- and storm-damaged area. The seasonal maximum of large-scale wildfires and windthrows was observed in July. Also, we identified the statistically significant relationships of fire- and wind-related forest damage with environmental variables. The occurrence of large-scale wildfires is related mainly to the species composition of forests, and also to the altitude, the mean annual precipitation and the population density. The spatial distribution of massive windthrows has a strong correlation with the species composition of forests, the mean annual precipitation and partially with the wind effect parameter. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Forest fires; Global Forest Change data; Landsat images; Long-term data series; Spatio-temporal distribution; Ural region; Windthrows","community composition; environmental disturbance; forest fire; Landsat; satellite data; spatial distribution; storm; temporal distribution; windthrow; Urals","Shikhov, A.N.; Perm State UniversityRussian Federation; email: shikhovan@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",0921030X,,,,"English","Nat.

Therefore, foresters need forest management strategies to reduce the damage risk. This paper focused on the damage patterns within the forest as the final results of multiple tree-wind dynamic interactions in time and space during a storm. Recent developments in computer technology allow for the possibility of simulating the complex and dynamic phenomena of damage during a storm but are extremely time consuming. To simplify the simulations without losing the crucial aspects of wind damage in forests, we introduced a computer simulation model using the agent-based modelling (ABM) technique, which capture the phenomena and interactions of individuals called ‘agents’. We created an ABM for forest wind damage simulation, coupling together an accepted understanding of wind gusts in forests, tree bending moments, and damage propagation. The model was tested with variations in three conditions: trees acclimated and unacclimated to their wind environment; three levels of gust strength; and three tree planting densities. The ABM was able to replicate damage patterns and demonstrate damage propagation within the forest and the effects of forest edges. The difference in the rate of damage in the forest between acclimated and unacclimated edges became similar with an increase in the gust intensity, and a decrease in tree density through a reduction in the shelter effect of the forest. The ABM could be improved in the future by parametrizing the variation in individual tree resistance, and the variation in gust and wind strength, as well as adding more information on local environmental conditions such as topography and soil variation, and storm characteristics such as duration and intensity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based model; Damage pattern; Damage propagation; Forest edge; Gust; Wind damage","agrometeorology; biomechanics; computer simulation; environmental disturbance; environmental stress; forest ecosystem; forest edge; gust; storm surge; wind forcing","Kamimura, K.; School of Science and Technology, Shinshu University, 8304 Minamiminowa, Kamiina, Japan; email: kamimura@shinshu-u.ac.jp",,"Elsevier B.V.",01681923,,AFMEE,,"English","Agric.

One common strategy to facilitate these goals is to seed fast-growing legumes combined with one application of P-fertiliser to maximise legume growth and increase soil-N. However, the longer term effects of this strategy have received little attention. Here we report the results of a 15-year-old experiment that was established to test the effects of fertiliser-P application and seeding large understorey legumes, both singly and in combination, on jarrah forest restoration after bauxite mining. Fifteen years after the establishment of this experiment, the majority of the seeded legumes had senesced, with total legume cover having declined significantly compared with results of the same experiment at 5-years-of-age. Yet, despite the legumes having senesced there were still negative effects of both large legumes and P-fertiliser on species richness and abundance of non-leguminous understorey species. These negative effects may be mediated by the persistent effects of legume competition that was evident at 5 years and the accumulation of significant quantities of leaf litter and fine woody debris in the large legume × P-addition treatments. Compared with the 0 kg P ha −1 treatment, application of 20 kg P ha −1 significantly increased jarrah tree growth, but there was no additional benefit of 80 kg P ha −1 . These data suggest that moderation of P-fertiliser and large understorey legumes could maximise understorey cover, tree growth and understorey species richness, and therefore simultaneously address multiple key restoration goals. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Acacia; Competition; Fertilizer; Nitrogen; Rehabilitation","Bauxite deposits; Competition; Fertilizers; Forestry; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nutrients; Patient rehabilitation; Phosphorus; Restoration; Acacia; Common strategy; Fine woody debris; Mine restorations; Mining process; Nutrient cycling; Re-establishing; Species richness; Conservation; bauxite; competition (ecology); environmental restoration; experiment; fertilizer application; leaf litter; legume; mine; mining; nitrogen; phosphorus; remediation; species richness; woody debris; Competition; Fertilizers; Forestry; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Acacia; Eucalyptus marginata","Daws, M.I.; Environment Department, Alcoa of Australia Ltd, Huntly Mine, PO Box 172, Australia; email: m.i.daws@reading.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

We analyzed sediment profiles covering the past ~10,000 years from three lakes associated with an iron blast furnace in central Sweden, as an example of the many small-scale furnaces with historical roots in the medieval period. With a focus on long-term lake-water quality, we analyzed multiple proxies including geochemistry, pollen and charcoal, diatom composition and inferred pH, biogenic silica (bSi), visible near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS)-inferred lake-water total organic carbon (LW-TOC), and VNIRS-inferred sediment chlorophyll (sed-Chl). All three lakes had stable conditions during the middle Holocene (~5000 BCE to 1110 CE) typical of oligo-dystrophic lakes: pH 5.4–5.6, LW-TOC 15–18 mg L −1 . The most important diatom taxa include, for example, Aulacoseira scalaris, Brachysira neoexilis, and Frustulia saxonica. From ~1150 CE, decreases in LW-TOC, bSi, and sed-Chl in all three lakes coincide with a suite of proxies indicating disturbance associated with local, small-scale agriculture, and the more widespread use of the landscape in the past (e.g. forest grazing, charcoal production). Most important was a decline in LW-TOC by 30–50% in the three lakes prior to the 20th century. In addition, the one lake (Fickeln) downstream of the smelter and main areas of cultivation experienced a shift in diatom composition (mainly increasing Asterionella formosa) and a 0.6 pH increase coinciding with increasing cereal pollen and signs of blast furnace activity. The pH did not change in the other two lakes in response to disturbance; however, these lakes show a slight increase (0.3–0.5 pH units) because of modern liming. LW-TOC has returned to background levels in the downstream lake and remains lower in the other two. © The Author(s) 2019.","diatoms; environmental change; geochemistry; human impacts; lake-water carbon; sediment; total organic carbon","anthropogenic effect; boreal forest; chlorophyll; diatom; environmental change; environmental impact; geochemistry; historical record; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; lake water; Medieval; metallurgy; microcosm; mining; smelting; total organic carbon; water quality; Sweden; Asterionella formosa; Aulacoseira; Bacillariophyta; Brachysira; Frustulia saxonica","Myrstener, E.; Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, Umeå UniversitySweden; email: erik.myrstener@gmail.com",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",09596836,,HOLOE,,"English","Holocene",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061205652

One of the well-studied mechanisms by which forest wind and fire disturbances interact is that wind damage increases flammable fuels—amplifying the effects of fire—leading to unexpected changes in vegetation composition. However, wind disturbance may also buffer the effects of fire through mechanisms such as disrupting fuel continuity. The extent to which wind and fire disturbances buffer, or reduce, the magnitude of ecological change has been less well studied. In this study, we winched trees in a Pinus taeda L. forest to simulate wind damage in experimental plots and combined this treatment with prescribed fire. This design allowed investigation of how forest regeneration responds to combinations of wind and fire disturbance, with particular emphasis on whether disturbance interactions were amplifying or buffering. We also tested for evidence of two mechanisms of disturbance interaction that are expected to buffer the cumulative ecological impact of wind and fire disturbances, testing (1) whether wind damage increased resprouting response following fire and (2) whether seedlings on tip-up mounds were protected from fire. We identified evidence for a combination of disturbance interactions occurring in both an amplifying direction (e.g., rapid recruitment and establishment of Rhus copallinum) as well as interactions occurring in a buffering direction (e.g., increased resilience in resprouting saplings in winched plots). Such varying responses may lead to a heterogeneous mixture of amplifying and buffering effects following compounded disturbances, such that at the stand scale, the aggregate regeneration response of two disturbances is the net effect of these individual interaction mechanisms. The results of this study highlight that mechanisms of disturbance interactions may vary spatially and temporally and may be best understood by considering factors such as disturbance severity, species life history traits, and timing between disturbances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Amplifying effects; Antagonism; Buffering effects; Disturbance interactions; Prescribed fire; Synergism; Tornado; Wind damage","Ecology; Reforestation; Tornadoes; Amplifying effect; Antagonism; Buffering effect; Prescribed fires; Synergism; Wind damage; Fires; aggregate; antagonism; buffering; ecological impact; life history trait; prescribed burning; resprouting; tornado; Damage; Ecology; Fires; Impact; Reforestation; Synergism; Trees; Wind; Pinus taeda; Rhus copallinum","Cannon, J.B.; Colorado Forest Restoration Institute, Department of Forest and Rangeland Stewardship, Colorado State University, 1472 Campus Delivery, United States; email: jbcannon.pubs@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

We used remote-sensing datasets to characterize the past and future topographic impacts of surface coal mining on the mixed-mesophytic forests of eastern Kentucky. To provide context, we examined the consequences of widespread topographic rearrangement for an imperiled ridgetop-associated predator, the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus). We found that surface mining disproportionately impacts ridgetop habitats, causing large reductions in suitable habitat for C horridus, and most likely other ridgetop-dependent biota as well. Land permitted for surface mining is also concentrated in high topographic positions, and patterns of habitat loss are therefore likely to remain concentrated within these ecosystems.

We collected the corrosion data of 17 low alloy steels under 6 atmospheric corrosion test stations in China over 16 years as the experimental datasets. Based on the datasets, a Random Forests model is established to implement the purpose of the corrosion rate prediction and data-mining. The results showed that the random forests can achieve the best generalization results compared to the commonly used machine learning methods such as the artificial neural network, support vector regression, and logistic regression. In addition, the results also showed that regarding the effect to the corrosion rate, environmental factors contributed more than chemical compositions in the low alloy steels, but as exposure time increases, the effect of the environmental factors will gradually become less. Furthermore, we give the effect changes of six environmental factors (Cl?? concentration, SO 2 concentration, relative humidity, temperature, rainfall, and pH) on corrosion with exposure time increasing, and the results illustrated that pH had a significant contribution to the corrosion of the entire process. The paper also dealt with the problem of the corrosion rate forecast, especially for changing environmental factors situations, and obtained the qualitative and quantitative results of influences of each environmental factor on corrosion. © 2019 by the authors.

To explore potential synergies between edge effects, fire and windstorm damage as causes of Amazonian forest degradation, we quantified vegetation responses to a 30-min, high-intensity windstorm that in 2012, swept through a large-scale fire experiment that borders an agricultural field. Our pre- and postwindstorm measurements include tree mortality rates and modes of death, above-ground biomass, and airborne LiDAR-based estimates of tree heights and canopy disturbance (i.e., number and size of gaps). The experimental area in the southeastern Amazonia includes three 50-ha plots established in 2004 that were unburned (Control), burned annually (B1yr), or burned at 3-year intervals (B3yr). The windstorm caused greater damage to trees (>10 cm DBH) in the burned plots (B1yr: 13 ± 9% of 785 trees; B3yr: 17 ± 13% of 433) than in the Control plot (8 ± 4% of 2,300; ± CI). It substantially reduced vegetation height by 14% in B1yr, 20% in B3yr and 12% in the Control plots, while it reduced above-ground biomass by 18% of 77.7 Mg/ha (B1yr), 31% of 56.6 (B3yr), and 15% of 120 (Control). Tree damage was greatest near the agricultural field edge in all three plots, especially among large trees and in B3yr. Trunk snapping (70%) and uprooting (20%) were the most common modes of tree damage and mortality, with the height of trunk failure on the burned plots often corresponding with the height of historical fire scars. Of the windstorm-damaged trees, 80% (B1yr), 90% (B3yr), and 57% (Control) were dead 4 years later. Trees that had crown damage experienced the least mortality (22%–60%), followed by those that were snapped (55%–94%) and uprooted (88%–94%). Synthesis. We demonstrate the synergistic effects of three kinds of disturbances on a tropical forest. Our results show that the effects of windstorms are exacerbated by prior degradation by fire and fragmentation. We highlight that understorey fires can produce long-lasting effects on tropical forests not only by directly killing trees but also by increasing tree vulnerability to wind damage due to fire scars and a more open canopy. © 2018 The Authors.

We used a set of ten, 0.4-ha plots established in 1935 and measured every 5-13 years to examine the cumulative effects of multiple wind disturbance events in the coastal forests of Oregon. Since 1935 there have been ten documented wind events in coastal Oregon with hurricane-force winds. Most of the eight windstorms since 1962 noticeably influenced at least one plot; however, no individual storm clearly influenced all plots. Net rate of biomass accumulation of plots was negative when biomass mortality exceeded 29-41 Mg/ha per 5-year period (or 3.4%-5.8% per 5 years). In contrast, wind disturbance did not clearly reduce NPP (Net Primary Production) in any plot until biomass mortality exceeded 50%. Major wind-related mortality episodes in individual plots did not necessarily strongly influence the average loss of biomass across all plots. For example, a biomass loss of 88% in one plot resulted in an average loss of only 3.4% across all plots. In contrast, the cumulative effect of multiple plots with repeated wind-related mortality did decrease biomass at the multi-plot level. Depending on the plot, wind caused 16%-59% of the total mortality over time, and the proportion of wind-related mortality has increased 5- to 8-fold since 1940. The majority (80%) of wind-related mortality was ""immediate"", but some trees survived up to 35 years after being significantly wind damaged. Despite western hemlock having a wind-related mortality rate that was at least twice that of Sitka spruce, the number of stems of the former species increased over time. This trend may be related to the predominant recovery mechanism which was the release of existing small trees and the fact that the majority of ingrowth was western hemlock. This study suggests that wind disturbance is a heterogeneous, gradual process and that while individual events have a detectable impact on structure and function, the largest impacts, at least in systems where it reoccurs each decade, are cumulative. © 2019 by the authors.","Cumulative effects; Disturbance; Forest regeneration; Long-term change; Mortality; Permanent plots; Windthrow","Biomass; Reforestation; Storms; Cumulative effects; Disturbance; Forest regeneration; Long term change; Mortality; Permanent plot; Windthrows; Population statistics; coniferous forest; disturbance; environmental factor; long-term change; mixed forest; mortality; net primary production; regeneration; wind field; Biomass; Mortality; Oregon; Picea Sitchensis; Reforestation; Trees; Tsuga Heterophylla; Wind; Oregon; United States; Picea sitchensis; Tsuga heterophylla","Harmon, M.E.; Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State UniversityUnited States; email: mark.harmon@oregonstate.edu",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061280164

The study area consists of 4 open pit mines surrounded by forestry area located in the Antalya province which is nearby the Mediterranean Sea known as one of the most popular holiday destinations in Turkey. Opposite to the expansion of the mine areas forestry area decreases in this region. To quantify the decrease in the forestry area multi-temporal satellite imageries were used for 4 open pit mines. Used data were Spot 5 and Spot 6 satellite images with spatial resolution of 5 m and 6 m respectively. Spatial change was determined by applying object-based classification method for all satellite images. Accuracy analyses were made by means of overall accuracy and kappa statistic values. The overall accuracy values of the classified imageries of 2011, 2014 and 2017 were respectively 94.81%, 94.0% and 97.1% with the kappa statistical values of 0.9212, 0.9070 and 0.9538.

Additionally, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used in one of the mine areas in order to realistic evaluation of an area by using orthophotos. Two orthophotos with the pixel sizes of 4 cm and 7 cm were produced from multi-temporal aerial photographs. As a result of the study, it can be said that remotely sensed imageries are the main data to temporal follow-up of the mine areas. In this context, UAVs have been shown to be a better option for monitoring the environmental effects of mining areas when criteria such as acquisition of the data, accuracy, speed and time are evaluated.

The area known as El Oro-Tlalpujahua Mining District in central Mexico was subjected to significant environmental impacts as a result of ore extraction, including profound habitat transformations, landscape changes, and the accumulation of potentially toxic elements in their tailings (favoring its bioavailability and dispersion). After more than 60 years without extractive activities, there is no knowledge on extant remaining impacts on biological communities. Assuming the presence of negative impacts on birds, we compared the composition and abundance of bird communities in two locations, representing a site without exposure to tailings (S1) and another one with tailings deposition (S2). From June 2014 to June 2015, we recorded 2828 individuals of 108 avian species in 369 point counts (S1 = 91, S2 = 95). The Chao1 indicator suggested we recorded 96% of the species present. We found a high similarity in the general composition and abundance of bird species between communities (&gt; 85%). However, there were significant differences in the abundances of 18 species (9 of them higher in the control site); these differences might result from differential effects of potentially toxic elements on functional groups (such as feeding guilds), resource availability, as well as other factors not accounted for. Historically, mining activities in the area generated significant changes in the structure and composition of the forest, and disrupted ecological processes. Despite the fact that current conditions appear favorable to the relative stability of the bird community, specific physiological effects on some species of birds sixty years after the cessation of mineral extraction could occur. Further studies on physiological performance and the effects of potentially toxic elements on local birds could unveil unknown effects at the individual level. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

In 1998, an ice storm damaged forest canopies and led to increased hydrologic losses of nitrogen (N) from the northern hardwood forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), a Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in New Hampshire, USA. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying this response, we experimentally simulated ice storms with different frequencies and severities at the small plot scale. We took measurements of plant and soil variables before (2015) and after (2016, 2017) treatments using the same methods used in 1998 with a focus on hydrologic and gaseous losses of reactive N, as well as rates of soil N cycle processes. Nitrogen cycle responses to the treatments were insignificant and less marked than the responses to the 1998 natural ice storm. Pools and leaching of inorganic N, net and gross mineralization and nitrification and denitrification rates, and soil to atmosphere fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) were unaffected by the treatments, in contrast to the 1998 storm which caused marked increases in leaching and watershed export of inorganic N. The difference in response may be a manifestation of N oligotrophication that has occurred at the HBEF over the past 30 years. Results suggest that ecosystem response to disturbances, such as ice storms, is changing due to aspects of global environmental change, challenging our ability to understand and predict the effects of these events on ecosystem structure, function, and services. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","climate change; denitrification; disturbance; mineralization; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nitrous oxide",,"Weitzman, J.N.; City University of New York Advanced Science Research Center at the Graduate CenterUnited States; email: WeitzmanJ@caryinstitute.org",,"Springer",14329840,,ECOSF,,"English","Ecosystems",Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075462400

However, there have been few long-term studies of the recovery of these systems following wind damage. Long-term studies of protected forest systems, such as Dinsmore Woods in Northern Kentucky, within the fragmented forest of this region are valuable as they provide a resource to document and understand the effect of both abiotic and biotic challenges to forest systems. This study is a 40-year analysis of both overstory and understory changes in the forest system at DinsmoreWoods as the result of damage caused by severe winds in the spring of 1974. The forest was surveyed before and immediately following the windstorm and then at 10-year intervals. Although the windstorm had an immediate effect on the forest, the pattern of damage was complex. The forest canopy (diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 30 cm) experienced an irregular pattern of damage while in the subcanopy (DBH ≤ 30 cm) there was a 25% reduction in total basal area. However, the major effects of the windstorm were delayed and subsequently have altered forest recovery. Ten years following the disturbance declines were seen in total density and basal area in the canopy and subcanopy of the forest as a consequence of windstorm damage. In the past 20 years the total basal area of the canopy has increased and exceeds the pre-disturbance total basal area. In contrast, the subcanopy total basal area continued to decline 20 years post-disturbance and has not recovered. Further openings in the canopy and subcanopy due to the delayed windstorm effects helped to establish a dense understory of native shrubs and sugar maple which have affected tree regeneration and is reflected in the continual decline in species diversity in the subcanopy and sapling strata over the 40-year period. © 2019 by the authors.","Forest recovery and regeneration; Kentucky; Old-growth forest; Overstory and understory changes; Windstorm damage","Recovery; Forest recovery; Kentucky; Old-growth forest; Overstory and understory changes; Windstorm damage; Reforestation; climate change; environmental disturbance; forest canopy; old-growth forest; overstory; population decline; regeneration; severe weather; understory; wind velocity; Basal Area; Damage; Kentucky; Patterns; Recovery; Reforestation; Systems; Wind; Kentucky; United States; Acer saccharum","Held, M.E.; Department of Biology, Saint Peter's University, NJ, United States; email: mheld@saintpeters.edu",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063860986

However, on the other hand, mining activities will lead to land degradation. The mining site needs major attention due to environmental damage caused. In addition to causing erosion and sedimentation, mining activities can lead to increase of heavy metal content in soils potentially entering the aquatic environment, decreasing the quantity and quality of water. Therefore, a repair or rehabilitation effort on post mining land is needed so as not to cause sustained damage.

Artisanal-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a large cause of this deforestation and brings with it extensive environmental, social, governance, and public health impacts, including large carbon emissions and mercury pollution. Underlying ASGM is a broad network of factors that influence its growth, distribution, and practices such as poverty, flows of legal and illegal capital, conflicting governance, and global economic trends. Despite its central role in land use and land cover change in the Western Amazon and the severity of its social and environmental impacts, it is relatively poorly studied. While ASGM in Southeastern Peru has been quantified previously, doing so is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of the resulting landscape. Using a novel approach to classify mining that relies on a fusion of CLASlite and the Global Forest Change dataset, two Landsat-based deforestation detection tools, we sought to quantify ASGM-caused deforestation in the period 1984-2017 in the southern Peruvian Amazon and examine trends in the geography, methods, and impacts of ASGM across that time. We identify nearly 100,000 ha of deforestation due to ASGM in the 34-year study period, an increase of 21% compared to previous estimates. Further, we find that 10% of that deforestation occurred in 2017, the highest annual amount of deforestation in the study period, with 53% occurring since 2011. Finally, we demonstrate that not all mining is created equal by examining key patterns and changes in ASGM activity and techniques through time and space. We discuss their connections with, and impacts on, socio-economic factors, such as land tenure, infrastructure, international markets, governance efforts, and social and environmental impacts. © 2018 by the authors.","Artisanal-scale gold mining; Commodity; Infrastructure; Landsat; Protected areas","Classification (of information); Conservation; Deforestation; Economic and social effects; Economic geology; Gold mines; International trade; Land use; Commodity; Gold mining; Infrastructure; LANDSAT; Protected areas; Environmental impact","Messinger, M.; Center for Energy, Environment, and Sustainability, Wake Forest University, 1834 Wake Forest Rd, United States; email: messmc9@wfu.edu",,"MDPI AG",20724292,,,,"English","Remote Sens.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058879365

Soil processes such as the recycling of organic matter, energy and nutrients are controlled by soil fauna. However, little is still known about the post-disturbance recovery of soil microarthropod communities in forest stands exposed to windthrow of various severity and post-windthrow forest management over time. This study assessed soil Collembola community recovery in pine forest stands over the long-term (between 9 and 14 years after the disturbance event). We predicted that (1) different severity of windthrow disturbance in a pine forest has different effects on the recovery of Collembola community composition and functional structure, even after 10 years; (2) The recovery of Collembola communities is similar during regeneration of a forest disturbed by windthrow and in a pine plantation planted after clearing of a windthrown forest and subsequent soil preparation; (3) The changes in the Collembola community during forest regeneration after windthrow disturbance can be explained by selected environmental variables, especially the leaf area index LAI. As expected, regeneration processes within forest stands shifted the species composition of collembolan communities and changed their functional structure. The surface dwelling collembolan species (epigeic and atmobiotic life form) responded to regeneration processes mainly in pine stands, especially in a pine plantation established after a clearing of broken pines and subsequent soil preparation. Our results suggest different sensitivity of collembolan communities to environmental changes induced by various degrees of opening of the tree canopy by windthrow and to those caused by the post disturbance treatment. These findings confirm that collembolan community composition recovery is slow and divergent during natural regeneration of pine stands and regeneration by planting but does not differ between moderately and severely successional trajectories. Our results also confirm the importance of canopy closure for the possibility of Collembola community regeneration. If canopies were more closed (higher leaf area index, LAI index), the possibility of regeneration increased, especially in the young pine plantations, as seen in the final years of our study. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Disturbances; Forest ecosystems; Functional traits; IndVal; LAI index; Principal response curve PRC; Succession","Animals; Ecosystems; Recovery; Soils; Disturbances; Forest ecosystem; Functional traits; IndVal; LAI index; Response curves; Succession; Reforestation; arthropod; community composition; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; disturbance; environmental change; forest canopy; forest management; leaf area index; plantation forestry; soil fauna; soil organic matter; stand structure; succession; windthrow; Animals; Ecosystems; Natural Reforestation; Pinus; Processes; Recovery; Soil; Collembola; Hexapoda","Skłodowski, J.; Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Department of Forest Protection and Ecology, Nowoursynowska 159, Poland; email: jsklodowski@wl.sggw.pl",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

We investigated filters through a long-term study examining reptile and mammal recolonization of, and population persistence in, post-mining restoration in the northern jarrah forest of southwestern Australia. Neither mammal community composition, nor individual mammal species, differed between unmined forest and restoration but reptile communities did and some reptile species were significantly less abundant in restoration than in unmined forest. We concluded that there were no filters to mammal recolonization and persistence but that there were both unidirectional (decreasing gradually over time) and dynamic (fluctuating over time) filters to reptile recolonization of post-mining restoration that influenced both recolonization and population persistence of some reptile species. Low volumes of coarse woody debris appeared to be a unidirectional filter that will slow recolonization by some reptile species for decades or even centuries. Canopy cover appeared to be a dynamic filter that fluctuated over a period of >7 years and precluded population persistence of some reptile species that had already recolonized the post-mining restoration. A dearth of studies made it difficult to generalize how widespread these filters were in restoration areas but studies of thinning and burning in natural forests suggested they were likely to be widespread. Although management techniques to reduce the effect of unidirectional and dynamic filters remain poorly developed, their development and adoption will improve the ability of restoration to facilitate fauna recolonization and persistence and better contribute towards biodiversity conservation. © 2018 Ecological Society of Australia","biodiversity; conservation; eucalypt; long-term; mammal; management; reptile; succession","biodiversity; community composition; conservation management; environmental factor; environmental restoration; evergreen forest; fauna; long-term change; longevity; mammal; recolonization; reptile; restoration ecology; succession; temporal analysis; Australia; Jarrah Forest; Western Australia; Eucalyptus marginata; Mammalia; Reptilia","Craig, M.D.; Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions, School of Biological Sciences, University of Western AustraliaAustralia; email: M.Craig@murdoch.edu.au",,"Blackwell Publishing",14429985,,AUECF,,"English","Austral Ecol.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050857145

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) produces detailed 3D maps of forest canopy structure from which aboveground carbon density can be estimated. Working with a ALS dataset collected over the 8049-km2 Wellington Region of New Zealand we create maps of indigenous forest carbon and evaluate the influence of wind by examining how carbon storage varies with aspect. Storms flowing from the west are a common cause of disturbance in this region, and we hypothesised that west-facing forests exposed to these winds would be shorter than those in sheltered east-facing sites. Methods: The aboveground carbon density of 31 forest inventory plots located within the ALS survey region were used to develop estimation models relating carbon density to ALS information. Power-law models using rasters of top-of-the-canopy height were compared with models using tree-level information extracted from the ALS dataset. A forest carbon map with spatial resolution of 25 m was generated from ALS maps of forest height and the estimation models. The map was used to evaluate the influences of wind on forests. Results: Power-law models were slightly less accurate than tree-centric models (RMSE 35% vs 32%) but were selected for map generation for computational efficiency. The carbon map comprised 4.5 million natural forest pixels within which canopy height had been measured by ALS, providing an unprecedented dataset with which to examine drivers of carbon density. Forests facing in the direction of westerly storms stored less carbon, as hypothesised. They had much greater above-ground carbon density for a given height than any of 14 tropical forests previously analysed by the same approach, and had exceptionally high basal areas for their height. We speculate that strong winds have kept forests short without impeding basal area growth. Conclusion: Simple estimation models based on top-of-the canopy height are almost as accurate as state-of-the-art tree-centric approaches, which require more computing power. High-resolution carbon maps produced by ALS provide powerful datasets for evaluating the environmental drivers of forest structure, such as wind. © 2017, The Author(s).","Airborne laser scanning; Carbon; Climate change; Cyclone; Forest; LiDAR; LUCAS; New Zealand; Remote sensing; Wind",,"Coomes, D.A.; Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, United Kingdom; email: dac18@cam.ac.uk",,"SpringerOpen",20956355,,,,"English","For.

The study sites were 31 small heaps of waste rock covered by an 80–120 year old beech forest. The sites were described in terms of plant coverage, species richness and composition, and the composition of plant traits. Three types of understory communities that were identified were compared for environmental variables and plant parameters. Despite a high concentration of heavy metals in soils, namely Cd, Pb, and Zn, the degree of shading by the tree canopy was the main factor determining variation in understory communities. The understories that developed in low and strong shading were similar to some extent: They had high number of species, and they were characterized by a high proportion of the ancient forest species. The species composition changed substantially with increasing coverage of trees; mixed strategy plants withdrew, while the stress tolerant species became more abundant. The other predictor of community structure was the ratio of Cd to Ca, which was responsible for the decrease of woody plants and the endangered species. This study proved that, in the case of highly complex and productive ecosystems, even with a high degree of contamination with heavy metals, the biotic factors play a primary role. © 2018","Beech forests understory vegetation; Heavy metal; Historical mining; Species composition; Species diversity; Species traits","cadmium; calcium; lead; zinc; heavy metal; lead; zinc; community structure; concentration (composition); deciduous forest; lead; mining; pollution effect; species diversity; vegetation dynamics; zinc; Article; beech forest; controlled study; environmental impact; forest; habitat; mining; plant parameters; soil analysis; soil chemistry; species composition; species diversity; vegetation dynamics; analysis; beech; chemistry; ecosystem; pH; Poland; soil; soil pollutant; tree; Poland [Central Europe]; Fagus; Ecosystem; Fagus; Forests; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Mining; Poland; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Trees; Zinc",,,"Academic Press",01476513,,EESAD,"30170317","English","Ecotoxicol.

Litterfall showed homogeneous Δ199Hg values [-0.18 ± 0.05‰, i.e., a modern gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) isotopic signature]. After litter decomposition, Hg bound to organic matter (OM) is mixed with Hg from pristine (-0.55 ± 0.22‰) or gold-mined (-0.09 ± 0.16‰) mineral materials. Negative Δ199Hg values in deep pristine mineral horizons (-0.60 ± 0.16‰) suggest the transfer of Hg bound to dissolved OM depleted in odd isotopes due to mass-independent fractionation during Hg abiotic reduction. Perennial palm tree leaves collected above gold-mined and pristine soil recorded contrasting Δ199Hg signatures likely resulting from GEM re-emission processes from soils and leaf surfaces. Upslope, soil δ202Hg signatures showed a negative shift (ϵ ∼-1‰) with depth attributed to mass-dependent fractionation during Hg sorption and complexation onto iron oxides and dissolved OM. Downslope, higher δ202Hg values in soils resulted from hydromorphy [lower humification, greater Hg(II) reduction, etc.]. The unique Hg isotopic signatures of Amazonian soils probably result in multistep fractionation processes during pedogenesis (millions of years) and in a potentially different Hg isotopic signature of preanthropogenic background GEM. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Economic geology; Iron oxides; Isotopes; Soil pollution; Soils; Tropics; Abiotic reduction; Fractionation process; Isotopic fractionations; Isotopic signatures; Litter decomposition; Mass-independent fractionation; Mineral materials; Tropical forest soils; Mercury compounds; gold; iron oxide; mercury; gold; catena; complexation; forest soil; gold; isotopic fractionation; mercury (element); mining; pedogenesis; tropical forest; Article; bioturbation; canopy; combustion; complex formation; controlled study; forest soil; fractionation; French Guiana; isotope analysis; litter decomposition; mining; pedogenesis (soil); tropical rain forest; environmental monitoring; forest; mining; soil; Amazonia; French Guiana; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; French Guiana; Gold; Mercury; Mercury Isotopes; Mining; Soil","Guédron, S.; Univ.

In order to close this knowledge gap, we took advantage of a tornado event, which occurred in July 2012 in Trzebciny Forest District in northwest Poland. The main objective of this study was to determine how two completely different reforestation techniques in windthrow areas impact net ecosystem production (NEP) of this Scots pine forest ecosystem under similar meteorological conditions. The two techniques were: conventional (“Tlen I” site): uprooted stumps pulled out and removed from the site followed by ploughing, and non-conventional (“Tlen II” site): all stumps left on the site to decompose with no ploughing. Therefore, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes using the eddy covariance (EC) technique for four continuous years. Our results indicate that both sites became significant carbon (C) sources after the windthrow (up to 575 ± 56 g C m−2 y-1 in the first year, Tlen I). However, the Tlen I (conventional technique) lost over 30% less C than Tlen II during the 2015–2016 observation period. In contrast to existing knowledge, ploughing as done at Tlen I, did not substantially increase CO2 emission, as compared to local soil ripping (non-conventional technique). The decrease in net C emission, estimated on the basis of linear model parameters, was almost five times greater at Tlen I than at Tlen II. We thus hypothesize that the annual NEP at conventionally reforested windthrow site will reach C neutrality (NEP = 0) six years after windthrow at most, while at the non-conventionally managed area it will probably take ca. 18 years. So far then, the currently widely applied conventional reforestation technique in wind-disturbed Polish forest appeared to be more effective in decreasing C losses than a technique that leaves stumps to decompose and avoids ploughing. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Eddy covariance; Meteorological extremes; Net ecosystem exchange; Net ecosystem productivity","carbon balance; climate conditions; comparative study; coniferous forest; eddy covariance; environmental disturbance; extreme event; forest ecosystem; net ecosystem exchange; net ecosystem production; reforestation; tornado; windthrow; Poland [Central Europe]; Pinus sylvestris","Ziemblińska, K.; Department of Meteorology, Poznań University of Life Sciences, Piątkowska 94, Poland; email: klaudiaziemblinska@up.poznan.pl",,"Elsevier B.V.",01681923,,AFMEE,,"English","Agric.

Saltmarshes are under threat from sea level rise, landward migration of mangroves, and in urban regions from habitat loss, input of litter, nutrients, and other contaminants. In urbanised catchments, saltmarsh areas receive nutrient-enriched and pollutant-contaminated run-off, such as heavy metals, through the stormwater system. This study aimed to investigate the impact of urban stormwater on saltmarsh and mangrove species composition and distribution. To test the effect of stormwater run-off in urbanised catchments on saltmarsh communities, we analysed the soil for pollutant elements, salinity and nutrient concentration and recorded vegetation composition at eight sites in the Sydney region, Australia. We found that elevated total nitrogen (>0.4 wt%) and reduced salinity of the soil downslope of stormwater outlets facilitates establishment of exotic plants and might promote migration of mangroves into saltmarshes, resulting in a squeezing effect on the distribution of saltmarsh vegetation. Saltmarsh cover was significantly lower below stormwater outlets and exotic plant cover increased significantly with sediment calcium concentrations above 8840 mg/kg, which are associated with stormwater run-off. However, this effect was found to be strongest in highly industrialised areas compared to residential areas. Understanding the impact of pollutants on coastal wetlands will improve management strategies for the conservation of this important endangered ecological community. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Exotic plants; Heavy metals; Intertidal wetlands; Mangrove encroachment; Nutrients; Pollution","Biodiversity; Catchments; Conservation; Ecosystems; Heavy metals; Nutrients; Pollution; Runoff; Sea level; Storms; Vegetation; Wetlands; Biodiversity conservation; Calcium concentration; Environment protection; Exotic plants; Intertidal wetland; Mangrove encroachment; Nutrient concentrations; Vegetation composition; Soil pollution; calcium; nitrogen; storm water; concentration (composition); freshwater environment; intertidal environment; mangrove; runoff; saltmarsh; stormwater; Article; Australia; catchment; controlled study; environmental impact; exotic species; freshwater environment; industrial area; mangrove; priority journal; residential area; runoff; salinity; salt marsh; sediment; soil pollutant; species composition; species distribution; urban area; vegetation; Rhizophoraceae","Geedicke, I.; Macquarie University, Department of Biological SciencesAustralia; email: ina.geedicke@hdr.mq.edu.au",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,,"English","Sci.

One of the concerns relates to increases in edge effects, which among other things affects the forest microclimate that influences the distribution and behavior of species. In Alberta, Canada, boreal anthropogenic disturbances from in situ oil exploration are increasing forest fragmentation, especially in the form of exploratory well pads and seismic lines (i.e., linear forest clearings created during the exploration phase of oil extraction). Dissection of these forests by seismic lines has the potential to change local patterns in wind and light, and thus may alter forest communities. Although alterations of these abiotic conditions are likely, the magnitude of these changes is unknown, particularly the effects of changes in the width and orientation of linear disturbances. Here we investigated changes in light and wind on seismic lines compared to that of adjacent undisturbed forests and nearby cleared openings. Specifically, we examined how seismic line characteristics (i.e., line direction, line width, and adjacent canopy height) altered local responses in these abiotic conditions. Generalized Linear Mixed Effect models predicted a 2-fold increase in average light intensity and maximum wind speeds, and a 4-fold increase in average wind speeds on seismic lines compared to adjacent forests. These changes did not approach the conditions in large openings, which compared to forests had a 3-fold increase in average light intensity, a 16-fold increase in average wind speeds, and a 4-fold increase in maximum wind speeds. Line width and orientation interacted with adjacent forest height altering the abiotic environment with wider lines having a 3-fold increase on maximum wind speed.

Using tree demographic data from four large, tropical forest dynamics plots that differ in cyclonic storm frequency, we compare tree population and community dynamics. Additionally, we assess the effect of cyclonic storms on three functional traits, specific leaf area, wood density, and tree height of the dynamic tree assemblages. Mortality, growth and recruitment rates and the intrinsic rates of population growth of species differed across the plots, and were most dynamic, especially for stems 1-2 cm in diameter, at the plot which had an intermediate level of cyclonic storm frequency. Functional assemblages of species had the greatest degree of temporal variation in relation to disturbance, as measured by the change in functional divergence for the two plots with more intermediate cyclonic storm recurrence. Therefore, cyclonic storms affecting these plots generally have a greater effect on forest composition and dynamism than comparable cyclonic storms do on the plot which experiences cyclonic storms more frequently. Thus, we provide some evidence that community-wide demographic resistance to cyclonic storms is generally lower at an intermediate frequency of storms. While cyclonic storm strength and timing are important determinants of the within forest variation in tree dynamics and functional trait assemblages, we also show that cyclonic storm timing and frequency shapes tropical forest dynamics and functional composition across forests. We conclude that, over a given time interval, sites with intermediate levels of damaging cyclonic wind disturbance express a greater potential for life-history variation in the forest community, when compared to sites with less or more frequent disturbance. © 2018 by the authors.","Barro Colorado Island; Cyclonic wind disturbance; Forest demography; Forest resistance; Functional traits; Fushan; Hurricanes; Luquillo; Palanan; Tree growth; Tree mortality; Typhoons","Climate change; Dynamics; Hurricanes; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Storms; Tropics; Barro colorado islands; Forest demography; Functional traits; Fushan; Luquillo; Palanan; Tree growth; Tree mortality; Wind disturbance; Forestry; community dynamics; cyclone; demography; environmental disturbance; forest dynamics; hurricane; mortality; tree; tropical forest; typhoon; Dynamics; Forestry; Frequency; Sites; Time Measurement; Trees; Tropics; Wind; Barro Colorado Island; Panama Oeste; Panama [Central America]","Hogan, J.A.; Department of Biological Sciences, International Center for Tropical Botany, Florida International UniversityUnited States; email: jhogan@fiu.edu",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049637014

This hypothesis was tested in a 26-year chronosequence of seven lightly fertilized, oxidic soil materials restored to eucalypt forest communities after bauxite mining. Methods: Total P (Pt) status, Hedley P fractions and partial chemical speciation (NaOH-EDTA extraction and analysed using solution 31P NMR spectroscopy) were determined in the restored soils. Results: Concentrations of Pt and most Hedley fractions changed with restoration period, declined with depth and were strongly positively correlated with C and N concentrations. Biological P dominated the Labile and Intermediate P fractions while Long-term P was dominantly inorganic. Organic P concentrations in NaOH-EDTA extracts and their chemical natures were similar in restored and unburned native forest sites. Phosphomonoesters were the dominant class of organic P. Conclusions: Surprisingly rapid P accretion and fractional changes occurred over 26 years, largely in the surface soils and closely associated with organic matter status. Alkaline hydrolysis products of phosphodiesters and pyrophosphate indicated the importance of microbial P cycling. The important consequences for long-term ecosystem development and biological diversity require further study. © 2018, The Author(s).","Mining; Oxisols; P-fractionation; P-speciation; Pedogenesis; Restoration","chronosequence; ecosystem dynamics; environmental restoration; evergreen forest; forest; forest soil; fractionation; hypothesis testing; long-term change; microbial activity; mining; nutrient cycling; organic matter; Oxisol; pedogenesis; phosphorus; speciation (chemistry); tropical forest","Tibbett, M.; Centre for Agri-environmental Research and Soil Research Centre, School of Agriculture, Policy and Development, University of Reading, Whiteknights, PO Box 237, United Kingdom; email: m.tibbett@reading.ac.uk",,"Springer International Publishing",0032079X,,PLSOA,,"English","Plant Soil",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048158796

How exactly regeneration proceeds, however, is still a matter of debate: does-due to the specific site conditions-regeneration follows a true auto-succession with exactly the same set of species driving regeneration that was present prior to the disturbance, or do different trajectories of regeneration exist? Considering the fundamental ecosystem services mangroves provide, a better understanding of their recovery is crucial. The Honduran island of Guanaja offers ideal settings for the study of regeneration dynamics of storm-impacted mangrove forests. The island was hit in October 1998 by Hurricane Mitch, one of the most intense Atlantic storms of the past century. Immediately after the storm, 97% of the mangroves were classified as dead. In 2005, long-term monitoring on the regeneration dynamics of the mangroves of the island was initiated, employing permanent line-transects at six different mangrove localities all around the island, which have been revisited in 2009 and 1016. Due to the pronounced topography of the island, different successional pathways emerge depending on the severity of the previous disturbance. © 2018 by the authors.","Guanaja; Hurricane disturbance; Mangrove regeneration; Successional pathways","ecosystem resilience; ecosystem service; environmental disturbance; Hurricane Mitch 1998; mangrove; monitoring; regeneration; storm; Guanaja; Honduras; Islas de la Bahia; Rhizophoraceae","Fickert, T.; Physical Geography, University of Passau, Innstraße 40, Germany; email: thomas.fickert@uni-passau.de",,"MDPI AG",14242818,,,,"English","Diversity",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042219916

This study examines the effects of species, size, and overstory environment on occurrence, source, and severity of damage sustained by planted understory trees in a mature Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) forest as a result of the glaze event that struck the central Oregon Coast Range in November 2014. Understory tree species were Douglas-fir, grand fir (Abies grandis (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindl.), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), and western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don). Overall, western redcedar was damaged least frequently, and western hemlock was damaged most frequently. Redcedar was less susceptible to crown damage and more susceptible to bending damage than the other three species, while hemlock showed the opposite trend. We found significantly lower (P < 0.001) likelihoods of ice loading damage to understory trees from increasing overstory basal area under both conifers and hardwoods, but significantly higher (P = 0.006 and P < 0.001 respectively) likelihoods of damage from falling debris. The opposition of these trends resulted in no change in likelihood of damage occurrence with increasing overstory conifer density (P = 0.544), while likelihood of damage was higher under increasing hardwood density (P < 0.001). In examining the influence of tree size, we found that increasing diameter at breast height resulted in a significantly lower likelihood of bending (P = 0.009), but a significantly higher likelihood of crown loss (P < 0.001). Finally, we saw significantly higher likelihoods of both bending (P < 0.001) and crown loss (P = 0.009) with increasing height:diameter ratio. These results suggest that managers may want to consider overstory environment, species, and understory tree size when planning for the risk of future glaze events. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Disturbance; Douglas-fir; Ice damage; Oregon Coast Range; Stand dynamics; Understory","Glazes; Hardwoods; Ice; Storms; Disturbance; Douglas fir; Oregon coast ranges; Stand dynamics; Understory; Forestry; basal area; coniferous forest; damage; diameter; environmental disturbance; environmental effect; forest management; height; ice storm; overstory; species diversity; stand dynamics; tree; understory; Damage; Forestry; Pseudotsuga; Coast Ranges; Oregon; Pacific Northwest; United States; Abies grandis; Coniferophyta; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Thuja plicata; Tsuga heterophylla","Priebe, J.E.; Oregon State University, Department of Forest Engineering, Resources and Management, 280 Peavy Hall, United States; email: jepriebe@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

The objective of this study was to estimate individual and coupled effects of droughts and wind-storms on adult tree mortality across a 31-year period in 115 managed, mixed coniferous forest stands from the Western Alps and the Jura mountains. For each stand, yearly mortality was inferred from management records, yearly drought from interpolated fields of monthly temperature, precipitation and soil water holding capacity, and wind-storms from interpolated fields of daily maximum wind speed. We performed a thorough model selection based on a leave-one-out cross-validation of the time series. We compared different critical wind speeds (CWSs) for damage, wind-storm, and stand variables and statistical models. We found that a model including stand characteristics, drought, and storm strength using a CWS of 25 ms−1 performed the best across most stands. Using this best model, we found that drought increased damage risk only in the most southerly forests, and its effect is generally maintained for up to 2 years. Storm strength increased damage risk in all forests in a relatively uniform way. In some stands, we found positive interaction between drought and storm strength most likely because drought weakens trees, and they became more prone to stem breakage under wind-loading. In other stands, we found negative interaction between drought and storm strength, where excessive rain likely leads to soil water saturation making trees more susceptible to overturning in a wind-storm. Our results stress that temporal data are essential to make valid inferences about ecological impacts of disturbance events, and that making inferences about disturbance agents separately can be of limited validity. Under projected future climatic conditions, the direction and strength of these ecological interactions could also change. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","ecological interactions; forest damage; forest management; lagged effects; model selection; time series","coniferous tree; damage; drought; ecological impact; ecological modeling; environmental stress; forest management; mixed forest; mortality; risk assessment; stand dynamics; time series; wind velocity; Alps; Jura Mountains; Western Alps; rain; water; drought; forest; France; soil; Switzerland; temperature; tree; wind; Droughts; Forests; France; Rain; Soil; Switzerland; Temperature; Trees; Water; Wind","Csilléry, K.; Center for Adaptation to a Changing Environment (ACE), ETH ZürichSwitzerland; email: kati.csillery@gmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13541013,,,"28580624","English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021838366

In addition, the proportional changes in the diversity of AMF to the distances from riverbanks were assessed. For this purpose, the riparian forest of the Maroon River, Iran was divided into three locations with a 200-meter wide zone in between. Thus, the locations studied were named Distance I (riverbank), Distance II (intermediate), and Distance III (farthest from riverbank). In each of these distances, 10 Tamarix arceuthoides and Populus euphratica of each species were randomly selected. At the same time, soil and root samples were collected from the rhizosphere of the tree species studied. Results indicated that totally 13 AMF species were observed in T. arceuthoides and 19 AMF species were recorded in P. euphratica rhizosphere belonging to 6 genera and 6 families.

Given this huge dimension, questions arose on how to manage these areas to keep the protection gap, i.e. the time period with reduced overall protection against natural hazards, short. Quantifications are presented for the stability of lying logs left in place, the frequency of post-disturbance mass movements, and the tree regeneration in windthrow areas. The average height above ground of unsalvaged lying logs decreased from 2.1 m shortly after disturbance to 0.8 m 20 years later. In the period 1990–2014, the number of avalanches in windthrow areas was markedly small, and annual rates of shallow landslides and debris flows in windthrow areas did not differ from rates in comparable undamaged forested areas. Regeneration density rarely exceeded 4000 stems ha−1 20 years post-windthrow at elevations above 1200–1500 m a.s.l. Mean height of tallest trees reached 5.6 m in areas that were cleared and 6.5 m in those left unsalvaged. Trees planted post-windthrow were 1.0–2.4 m taller than naturally regenerated ones. Practitioners rated the protective effect to be acceptable 24 years post-disturbance in only 5 out from 16 observed windthrow areas (31%), with planting trees as the main cause of success. We conclude that in protection forests the regeneration speed after disturbance rarely meets practitioner’s expectations in terms of both stem density and stand structure. However, leaving woody debris from wind disturbance in place proved to replace protective effects for an astonishingly long time. An intensive management with salvage logging, planting and even technical constructions seems therefore only inevitable on windthrown areas where risks seem too high based on hazard, damage potential and possible spread of bark beetles to nearby protection forests. A management alternative applicable to many other cases of windthrown protection forests is to plant trees between lying stems. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Extreme events; Natural regeneration; Planting; Protection gap; Woody debris","environmental protection; extreme event; forest management; mountain region; regeneration; tree planting; windthrow; woody debris; Alps; Switzerland; Scolytinae","Wohlgemuth, T.; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Zürcherstrasse 111, Switzerland; email: thomas.wohlgemuth@wsl.ch",,"Springer Verlag",16124669,,,,"English","Eur.

Wind disturbance is common in tropical forests, shaping structure, composition, and function, and influencing successional trajectories. However, little is known about the impacts of extreme winds on second-growth forests in fragmented landscapes, though these ecosystems are often located in mosaics of forest, pasture, cropland, and other land cover types. Indirect evidence suggests that fragmentation increases risk of wind damage in tropical forests, but no studies have found such impacts following severe storms. In this study, we ask whether fragmentation and forest type (old vs. second growth) were associated with variation in wind damage after a severe convective storm in a fragmented production landscape in western Amazonia. We applied linear spectral unmixing to Landsat 8 imagery from before and after the storm, and combined it with field observations of damage to map wind effects on forest structure and biomass. We also used Landsat 8 imagery to map land cover with the goals of identifying old- and second-growth forest and characterizing fragmentation. We used these data to assess variation in wind disturbance across 95,596 ha of forest, distributed over 6,110 patches. We find that fragmentation is significantly associated with wind damage, with damage severity higher at forest edges and in edgier, more isolated patches. Damage was also more severe in old-growth than in second-growth forests, but this effect was weaker than that of fragmentation. These results illustrate the importance of considering landscape context in planning tropical forest restoration and natural regeneration projects. Assessments of long-term carbon sequestration potential need to consider spatial variation in disturbance exposure. Where risk of extreme winds is high, minimizing fragmentation and isolation could increase carbon sequestration potential. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","Amazon; carbon; forest fragmentation; reforestation; remote sensing; second-growth forest; tropical forest; wind disturbance","carbon sequestration; carbon sink; environmental disturbance; habitat fragmentation; habitat mosaic; habitat restoration; Landsat; old-growth forest; reforestation; remote sensing; satellite imagery; stand structure; tropical forest; wild population; Amazonia; carbon; agricultural land; biomass; environmental protection; forest; Peru; remote sensing; wind; Biomass; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Farms; Forests; Peru; Remote Sensing Technology; Wind",,,"Ecological Society of America",19395582,,ECAPE,"28593704","English","Ecol.

Here, we studied the changes in 23 properties of jarrah-forest soils restored after bauxite mining (1.5, 7, 22 years post-restoration) and their correlative effects on the growth of bossiaea, a plant that grows in the jarrah-forest of Western Australia. We found that physico-chemical and biological properties of restored soils were different compared with properties of unmined soils, and were correlated with time post-restoration. In turn, biomass produced by bossiaea seedlings was correlated with time post-restoration. Differential correlative effects of restored soils properties translated into higher biomass produced by bossiaea in soils aged 22 years compared with biomass produced in younger soils and in unmined soils. Biomass variation of bossiaea seedlings grown in restored soils was matched to the physico-chemical and biological properties of the soils to detect correlative effects of individual soil properties on plant growth. We found that biomass produced by bossiaea seedlings was positively correlated with the number of bacterial-feeding nematodes in soils, a likely consequence of increased microbial biomass, and with the rate of CO2 produced by microbial respiration of phenolic compounds. Our data suggest recovery of physico-chemical and key biological properties of soil through restoration after bauxite mining, but overall, at 22 years soils were not recovered to reference conditions.

We analyzed seven decades of succession following a stand-replacing wind disturbance (in 1947) in Badínsky prales, one of the best preserved old-growth fir-beech forests in western Carpathians (Central Europe), and contrasted the post-disturbance development with changes that occurred in the adjacent undisturbed old-growth forest. Both the disturbed and undisturbed sections of the old-growth forest showed compositional and structural changes that differed in their starting point, magnitude, and ecological mechanisms, but forest composition, structure and light conditions appeared to be converging across the two disturbance histories. The windthrow was initially dominated by early-successional goat willow (Salix caprea L.) that declined in abundance, basal area, and growth over time as beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) gradually increased in both abundance and basal area to dominate all canopy layers by 2015. This increase in beech dominance over time within the windthrow mirrored increasing beech dominance in the undisturbed old-growth forest which was caused by the gradual decline of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). The fact that old-growth forests originally co-dominated by fir and beech appear to be transitioning to forests dominated by beech regardless of the disturbance history suggests that beech expansion may be a robust process that should be considered in both old-growth conservation and forest management where timber harvest with low canopy retention may have similar effects on forest dynamics as a stand-replacing windthrow. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Forest dynamics; Forest succession; Stand development; Western Carpathians; Wind disturbance","Ecology; Forest dynamics; Forest succession; Stand development; Western carpathians; Wind disturbance; Forestry; basal area; coniferous forest; decadal variation; deciduous forest; dominance; environmental disturbance; forest dynamics; forest management; long-term change; old-growth forest; stand dynamics; succession; wind stress; Basal Area; Fagus Sylvatica; Forests; Growth; Salix Caprea; Seasonal Variation; Wind; Badin Virgin Forest; Banskobystricky; Carpathians; Slovakia; Western Carpathians; Abies; Abies alba; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Salix caprea","Jaloviar, P.; Department of Silviculture, Faculty of Forestry, Technical University in Zvolen, T.G.

In order to improve the classification accuracy for land use of industrial and mining reclamation area and provide data support for land reclamation monitoring and supervision, this article explored the classification method based on grid-search and random forest algorithm for the reclamation area. Satellite and auxiliary dataset including GF-1 images, DEM (digital elevation model) and field investigation data were acquired in October 2016. The study area was Gulin County, Luzhou City, Sichuan Province. In order to obtain the real surface reflectance and reduce the atmospheric and environmental effects from the satellite images in this study, FLAASH atmospheric correction and geometric correction were used in the satellite image pre-processing with ENVI 5.3 software. A machine learning algorithm, random forest algorithm, was used because the method facilitated the use of ancillary data in classification. Feature selection was an important preprocessing step in many machine learning applications, which selected the smallest subset of relevant features that built robust learning models. In the paper, spectrum, topography, texture and space variables were included in feature selection, in order to differentiate the built-up areas and farmlands, and BCI (biophysical composition index) was calculated in spectrum features. Texture feature processing comprised principal component analysis. Local Moran' I reflecting spatial autocorrelation feature and Local Getis Ord Gi reflecting hotspot feature were selected to improve the result of classification further. The grid-search method based on OOB (Out-of-Bag) error was used to optimize parameter. Based on data image spectrum, topography, texture, space and other information, 33 feature variables were figured out from the feature selection step, and 4 combined models were constructed to carry out random forest classification experiment; and the precision was 82.79%, 84.91%, 86.75% and 88.16% respectively. To eliminate the redundant information in the 33 feature variables and reduce the image band dimensionality, the study adopted variable importance estimation and Relief F algorithm to select the principle feature variables to conduct classification according to random forest algorithm. Through the comparison between the Model 2, Model 4, SVM (support vector machine) and MLC (maximum likelihood classification) classification result respectively, the study indicates that the random forest algorithm based on grid-search parameter optimization can achieve the classification accuracy of 88.16% in the multi-feature variables frame. After different methods are used to reduce the dimension of variables, the classification accuracy can also be kept above 85%, and the accuracy is higher than SVM and MLC classification results under the same number of feature variables. The random forest classifier is superior to SVM and more capable of dealing with multidimensional characteristic variables. The random forest method based on grid-search can obtain high precision in land use classification applied in reclamation area. Based on this method, remote sensing image interpretation can well provide the technical support and rational reference for land reclamation monitoring and supervision. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

A data mining strategy was implemented in this study to assess the overall impact of traditional and innovative silviculture on stand structure in a sample of beech forests with varying dominant age, management history and stand structure in Italy. Harvesting intensity and stand sensitivity to treatment were investigated using a principal component analysis (PCA) run on a set of dendrometric and stand-structure variables measured before and after practice implementation at the scale of forest compartment. The PCA decomposed the overall impact of silviculture on forest structure in two manipulative effects: (i) structural changes between control and treatments, and (ii) the net manipulative effect of innovative versus traditional treatment. Our approach informs the sustainable management of forests, outlining between-site differences in stand structure and identifying a diversity gradient shaped by silvicultural practices.

Interactions between individual disturbance agents are a major component of disturbance regimes, yet how interactions contribute to their climate sensitivity remains largely unknown. Objectives: Here, our aim was to assess the climate sensitivity of disturbance interactions, focusing on wind and bark beetle disturbances. Methods: We developed a process-based model of bark beetle disturbance, integrated into the dynamic forest landscape model iLand (already including a detailed model of wind disturbance). We evaluated the integrated model against observations from three wind events and a subsequent bark beetle outbreak, affecting 530.2 ha (3.8 %) of a mountain forest landscape in Austria between 2007 and 2014. Subsequently, we conducted a factorial experiment determining the effect of changes in climate variables on the area disturbed by wind and bark beetles separately and in combination. Results: iLand was well able to reproduce observations with regard to area, temporal sequence, and spatial pattern of disturbance. The observed disturbance dynamics was strongly driven by interactions, with 64.3 % of the area disturbed attributed to interaction effects. A +4 °C warming increased the disturbed area by +264.7 % and the area-weighted mean patch size by +1794.3 %. Interactions were found to have a ten times higher sensitivity to temperature changes than main effects, considerably amplifying the climate sensitivity of the disturbance regime. Conclusions: Disturbance interactions are a key component of the forest disturbance regime. Neglecting interaction effects can lead to a substantial underestimation of the climate change sensitivity of disturbance regimes. © 2016, The Author(s).","Climate change impacts; Disturbance modeling; Forest disturbance interactions; Ips typographus; Picea abies; Windthrow","beetle; climate change; climate effect; ecological modeling; environmental disturbance; experimental study; forest ecosystem; global warming; montane forest; patch size; pest outbreak; sensitivity analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; Austria; Ips typographus; Picea abies; Scolytinae","Seidl, R.; Department of Forest- and Soil Sciences, Institute of Silviculture, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU) Vienna, Peter Jordan Straße 82, Austria; email: rupert.seidl@boku.ac.at",,"Springer Netherlands",09212973,,LAECE,,"English","Landsc.

The aim of this study is to prepare windthrow hazard maps based on logistic regression and random forest models in Nowshahr Forests, Mazandaran Province, Iran. First of all, 200 windthrow locations were identified from extensive field surveys and some reports. Out these, 140 (70%) locations were randomly selected as training data and the remaining 60 (30%) cases were used for the validation goals. In the next step, 10 predictive variables such as slope degree, slope aspect, altitude, Topographic Position Index (TPI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), distance to roads and skid trails, wind effect, soil texture, forest type and stand density were extracted from the spatial database. Subsequently, windthrow hazard maps were produced using logistic regression and RF models, and the results were plotted in ArcGIS. Finally, the area under the curves (AUC) and kappa coefficient were made for performance purposes. The validation of results presented that the area under the curve and kappa have a more accuracy for the random forest (97.5%, and 95%, respectively) than logistic regression (96.667%, and 93.333%, respectively) model. Therefore, this technique has more potentiality to be applied in the evaluation of windthrow phenomenon in forest ecosystems. Additionally, both models indicate that the spatial distribution of windthrow incidence likelihood is highly variable in this region. In general, the mentioned findings can be applied for management of future windthrow in favor of economic benefits and environmental preservation. © 2017, Federal University of Lavras.

Natural resource development, particularly surface mining in the rainforest, poses great risks to the region’s rich and endemic biodiversity. Here, we assessed the impact of surface mining and the success of forest rehabilitation on small mammal diversity in the Western Region of Ghana. We surveyed small mammals in the project area and two adjoining forest reserves (control sites) before the mining operation and 10 years after mine closure and forest rehabilitation (topsoil replacement and revegetation). The forest reserves recorded higher species abundance than the mining areas. Majority of the species captured in the forest reserves, including Hylomyscus alleni, Praomys tullbergi, Malacomys cansdalei, and Hybomys trivirgatus, are forest obligate species. Only one individual each of H. alleni and P. tullbergi was captured in the naturally regenerated areas (core areas of mining activities that were allowed to revegetate naturally), while 32 individuals belonging to four species (Lophuromys sikapusi, Mus musculoides, Mastomys erythroleucus, and Crocidura olivieri) were recorded in the rehabilitated areas. Our data suggested negative effects of mining on small mammal diversity and the restoration of species diversity and important ecological processes after rehabilitation of altered habitats. We strongly encourage deliberate conservation efforts, particularly the development of management plans that require the restoration of degraded land resulting from mining activities. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Ecosystem functions; Environmental impact assessment; Extinction risks; Land reclamation; Protected areas; Species diversity; Surface mining","Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Forestry; Land reclamation; Mammals; Mining; Open pit mining; Plant shutdowns; Restoration; Revegetation; Risk assessment; Soil conservation; Ecosystem functions; Extinction risks; Forest regeneration; Forest rehabilitation; Protected areas; Resource development; Terrestrial biodiversity; Tropical rain forest; Reforestation; biodiversity; ecosystem function; environmental impact assessment; extinction risk; land reclamation; mining; protected area; rainforest; regeneration; small mammal; species diversity; biodiversity; clinical article; controlled study; ecosystem regeneration; environmental impact assessment; Ghana; habitat; human; Mastomys erythroleucus; nonhuman; population abundance; Praomys; rehabilitation; revegetation; small mammal; species diversity; surface mining; animal; classification; ecology; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; Ghana; mammal; mining; procedures; regeneration; tree; Ghana; Western Region; Crocidura olivieri; Hybomys trivirgatus; Hylomyscus alleni; Lophuromys sikapusi; Malacomys cansdalei; Mammalia; Mastomys erythroleucus; Mus musculoides; Praomys tullbergi; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Ghana; Mammals; Mining; Regeneration; Trees","Ofori, B.Y.; Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University, North Ryde, Australia; email: byofori@yahoo.com",,"Springer International Publishing",01676369,,EMASD,"28451959","English","Environ.

This raises concerns about the migration of the beetle outbreak from non-intervention zones to adjacent managed forests. In this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of large-scale disturbances by intervention and non-intervention type of management in the Tatra mountains (Central Europe). We collected a time series of Landsat images from 2003 to 2014, and applied maximum likelihood classification to map the extent of forest, windthrow, clear-cuts, beetle outbreak and fire. Our classified maps achieved high overall accuracies: 0.93 ± 0.03 ⩽ OA ⩽ 0.96 ± 0.03. The extent of forest declined over the study period. We found higher rate of beetle induced tree mortality in non-intervention versus intervention zone. Within two growing seasons after the windthrow, beetle infestation occurred in close proximity to uncleared windthrow (<∼250 m), which suggest the positive effect of salvage logging (removal of windthrown trees) on lowering the risk of beetle outbreak. The two times higher sum of disturbances in intervention then in non-intervention zone indicated the limited impact of sanitation felling (removal of standing beetle infested trees) to reduce beetle population. However, sanitation felling highly contributed to the decline of the forest cover. Overall, our results document the dynamics of windthrow, bark beetle and clear-cuts by type of management, and limited impact of logging activities in reducing beetle outbreak in neighboring areas with intervention and non-intervention type of management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bark beetle outbreak; Clear-cuts; Disturbance detection; Landsat; Pest management","Conservation; Maximum likelihood; Sanitation; Bark beetle; Clear cuts; Disturbance detection; LANDSAT; Pest management; Forestry; accuracy assessment; beetle; clearcutting; detection method; environmental disturbance; forest cover; forest management; Landsat; logging (timber); map; mortality; pest control; pest outbreak; population decline; protected area; windthrow; Bark; Detection; Insects; Pest Control; Carpathians; Central Europe; Tatra Mountains; Coleoptera; Ips typographus; Scolytinae","Havašová, M.; Institute of Forest Ecology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Štúrova 2, Slovakia; email: maria.havasova@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Typically, windthrown timber is salvaged for economic and phytosanitary reasons. This markedly affects the natural development of the disturbed areas, in particular by removing important dead wood resources. For a sustainable and ecologically sound management of disturbance effects, more knowledge is needed on the impact of windthrow and salvage logging on animal species communities. We monitored various arthropod taxa (spiders and insects) two and five years after the storm Lothar in 1999 in salvaged and unsalvaged windthrows as well as in adjacent intact forests. Basing on a comprehensive data set with 1276 species and 228,718 individuals, species diversity, abundance and community composition were compared. Species richness and abundance of most taxonomic and functional groups (pollinators, saproxylics and predators) in the windthrow habitats clearly differed from those in the intact forests. On average, twice as many species were present in windthrows as in the forest. Windthrows also supported more red-listed beetles (mainly saproxylics) than the intact forest and more habitat indicator species (mainly Heteroptera and Aculeata) were found in windthrow areas. No difference in species diversity was found between salvaged and unsalvaged windthrows. However, similarity analyses showed that the communities of certain taxonomic and functional groups differed between the two salvaging treatments. A combination of unsalvaged and salvaged windthrows in intact forests increased local species richness approximately 2.5 times relative to that in the forests alone. Therefore after large-scale windthrows, a mosaic of salvaged and unsalvaged windthrow patches fosters high forest biodiversity levels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Disturbance; Insects; Saproxylic beetles; Similarity; Species richness; Timber harvest","Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecology; Ecosystems; Living systems studies; Logging (forestry); Timber; Disturbance; Insects; Saproxylic beetles; Similarity; Species richness; Timber harvests; Forestry; abundance; arthropod; beetle; biodiversity; climate change; community composition; disturbance; environmental disturbance; forest dynamics; forest management; functional group; insect; salvaging; similarity index; species diversity; species richness; timber harvesting; windthrow; Forests; Harvesting; Insects; Species Identification; Europe; Aculeata; Animalia; Araneae; Arthropoda; Coleoptera; Heteroptera; Hexapoda","Wermelinger, B.; WSL Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Forest Dynamics, Zürcherstrasse 111, Switzerland; email: beat.wermelinger@wsl.ch",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Our understanding of how forest disturbance affects the sources of soil CO2 efflux (Fs) is, however, poor. This may lead to uncertainties over future C sink estimates of forest ecosystems and associated feedbacks to the atmosphere. We investigated the impact of forest windthrow on the heterotrophic and autotrophic sources of Fs, underlying biotic and abiotic drivers (i.e. plant community composition, soil organic matter (SOM) properties and soil microclimate), and consequences for soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in situ along a disturbance chronosequence in the European Alps. This chronosequence facilitated the study of temporal changes in the above parameters between the third and sixth years after windthrow. Along the chronosequence, structural equation modelling revealed that soil temperature, soil moisture, SOM properties and plant community composition explained 90% of the variation in Fs. While no direct interactions among plants and SOM properties could be determined, plants significantly affected soil microclimate. Windthrow had no obvious effect on Fs because reduced autotrophic soil respiration (Ra) was offset by a ∼60% increase in heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh), principally due to increased soil temperatures. Ra after wind-throw was dominated by grasses and herbs rather than trees; however, a high abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi suggests an important indirect tree contribution to post-windthrow Ra. SOC stocks significantly declined over the post-windthrow period. Our results show that Rh was by far the dominant source of Fs after forest windthrow. As C losses from Rh and SOC stocks were in the same order of magnitude, this study demonstrates that post-windthrow declines in SOC stocks were mainly driven by a temperature-related increase in Rh.

We used a critical wind speed for the uprooting of trees as a measure of vulnerability, which together with the probability of such wind speed defined a level of risk. Based on that, we also predicted the stem volume of growing stock at risk and the amount of damage. In this work, medium fertility sites were planted to one of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), or silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) or to the tree species that was dominant before the final clear-felling. The vulnerability to wind damage, the volume of growing stock at risk, and the amount of damage all increased, increasing the most in the south when the proportion of Norway spruce (with shallow rooting) of the growing stock increased. Under a severe climate warming, the proportion of Norway spruce decreased the most in the south, opposite to that of birch. This decreased the risk of damage in autumn (when birch is leafless), unlike in summer. The low risk of damage in the north was due to the large proportion of Scots pine. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

Drought is a direct stressor of forests as well as a driver of secondary disturbance agents, making a full accounting of drought impacts challenging. General impacts can be inferred from moisture deficits quantified using precipitation and temperature measurements. However, derived meteorological indices may not meaningfully capture drought impacts because drought responses can differ substantially among species, sites and regions. Meteorology-based approaches also require the characterization of current moisture conditions relative to some specified time and place, but defining baseline conditions over large, ecologically diverse regions can be as difficult as quantifying the moisture deficit itself. In contrast, remote sensing approaches attempt to observe immediate, secondary, and longer-term changes in vegetation response, yet they too are no panacea. Remote sensing methods integrate responses across entire mixed-vegetation pixels and rarely distinguish the effects of drought on a single species, nor can they disentangle drought effects from those caused by various other disturbance agents. Establishment of suitable baselines from remote sensing may be even more challenging than with meteorological data. Here we review broad-scale drought monitoring methods, and suggest that an integrated data-mining approach may hold the most promise for enhancing our ability to resolve drought impacts on forests. A big-data approach that integrates meteorological and remotely sensed data streams, together with other datasets such as vegetation type, wildfire occurrence and pest activity, can clarify direct drought effects while filtering indirect drought effects and consequences. This strategy leverages the strengths of meteorology-based and remote sensing approaches with the aid of ancillary data, such that they complement each other and lead toward a better understanding of drought impacts. © 2016","Big data; Drought impacts; Drought indices; Forests; Monitoring; Remote sensing","Data mining; Drought; Forestry; Meteorology; Moisture; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Temperature measurement; Vegetation; Base-line conditions; Drought indices; Forests; Integrated data mining; Meteorological index; Moisture conditions; Remote sensing approaches; Remotely sensed data; Big data; air temperature; baseline conditions; climate effect; data mining; drought; environmental disturbance; environmental monitoring; environmental stress; forest management; integrated approach; precipitation (climatology); remote sensing","Norman, S.P.; USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, Eastern Forest Environmental Threat Assessment Center, 200 WT Weaver Blvd., United States; email: stevenorman@fs.fed.us",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

We found that soil respiration rate and annual cumulative CO2 emissions were significantly higher in heavily damaged sites than moderately and lightly damaged sites. Soil temperature was the most important environmental factor affecting soil respiration rate across all studied stands. However, soil respiration sensitivity to temperature (Q10) decreased in heavily damaged sites. Microbial biomass carbon and its proportion to total SOC increased with damage intensity. Soil respiration rate was positively correlated to microbial biomass carbon and soil moisture.

The restoration method, age (time since site abandonment/reclamation), groundwater table, slope, and aspect in all sampled plots were recorded in addition to the visual estimation of percentage cover of all present vascular plant species. Multivariate methods and GLM were used for the data elaboration. Restoration method was the major factor influencing species pattern. Both spontaneously revegetated and forestry reclaimed sites developed towards forest on a comparable timescale. Although the sites did not significantly differ in species richness (160 species in spontaneously revegetated vs. 111 in forestry reclaimed sites), spontaneously revegetated sites tended to be more diverse with more species of conservation potential (10 Red List species in spontaneous sites vs. 4 Red List species in forestry reclaimed sites).

To understand the relationships between gap size, changes in the soil environment and the effects that these changes have on soil processes, we investigated the effects of gap size on soil chemical and biological properties in the forest gaps in a Cunninghamia lanceolata stand in northern Guangdong Province, southern China. Ten naturally created gaps, five large (80-100 m2) and five small (30-40 m2), were selected in the stand of C. lanceolata. The large gaps showed a significant increase in light transmission ratio and air and soil temperatures and a decline in soil moisture, organic matter, N and P compared with the small gaps and the adjacent canopy-covered plots in the 0-10 cm soil. The differences in organic matter and nutrient levels found between the large and small gaps and the canopy-covered plots may be related to changes in environmental conditions. This indicated rapid litter decomposition and increased nutrient leaching in the large gaps.

Within the circumboreal region, forest management approaches have been adapted to emulate natural disturbance in order to promote biodiversity and ecosystem resilience. Few studies have evaluated windthrow outcomes in natural or managed old-growth boreal mixed-species stands, and these studies are primarily empirical. The objective of this study was to adapt the hybrid empirical-mechanistic ForestGALES_BC model, to investigate windthrow dynamics in natural and managed boreal old-growth stands, under various wind regimes. ForestGALES_BC was updated by adding biomechanical data for balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.). The model has the ability to simulate damage propagation during wind events by recalculating wind loading on a subject tree after failure of upwind trees. The number of iterations of this recalculation provides insights into the potential for propagation during longer duration storms. A simulation space made up of 500, 20 m × 20 m cells, was created using tree-lists from silviculture systems experiments in north eastern Quebec. The tree-lists for cells within the simulation space were edited to represent the plot conditions at the Quebec experimental sites, allowing simulation of a range of cell- (plot) and matrix-level (landscape) partial harvesting regimes. Above-canopy winds of various speeds were applied in order to test the initiation and propagation of damage within the simulated forest. Simulated outcomes were compared to observations of windthrow 6-7 years after partial harvesting at the field experimental site. Observed damage at the experimental site ranged from 1 to 40% of plot total basal area (mean = 14%, se = 1.96). For above-canopy wind speeds within the range expected for the experimental site, simulated windthrow levels in partial cuts ranged from 7 to 32% (mean = 12%, se = 1.94). When the combined effects of wind speed and number of iterations (~event duration) were investigated, event duration was more important for wind speeds over 20 m/s. By enabling simulation of outcomes at the tree, plot (cell) and stand (simulation space) levels, the model allows investigation of a wide range of harvesting strategies, and sets the stage for inclusion of wind disturbance in ecosystem succession models and other stand or landscape-level decision-support tools for forests in windy climates. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Balsam-fir; Disturbance; ForestGALES; Modelling; Old-growth; Wind damage","Biodiversity; Cells; Climate models; Cytology; Decision support systems; Ecology; Ecosystems; Models; Wind; Balsam fir; Disturbance; ForestGALES; Old growth; Wind damage; Forestry; biodiversity; boreal forest; coniferous tree; ecological modeling; ecosystem resilience; environmental disturbance; evergreen tree; forest management; old-growth forest; silviculture; wind velocity; windthrow; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Abies balsamea; Picea mariana","Anyomi, K.A.; University of British Columbia, Faculty of Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Canada; email: kenneth.anyomi@ubc.ca",,"Elsevier B.V.",03043800,,ECMOD,,"English","Ecol.

The infiltration rate in RMS was found ten times lower than the Sal forest. In comparison to Sal forest, the cumulative infiltration rate declines 85%, 80% and 75%, in RMS, topsoil and agriculture soil, respectively.

However, the strain regime in nature is exposed to a full spectrum of winds. We hypothesized that trees avoid overreacting by responding only to winds which bring information on local climate and/or wind exposure. Additionally, competition for light dependent on tree social status also likely affects thigmomorphogenesis. We monitored and manipulated quantitatively the strain regimes of 15 pairs of beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees of contrasting social status in an acclimated stand, and quantified the effects of these regimes on the radial growth over a vegetative season. Trees exposed to artificial bending, the intensity of which corresponds to the strongest wind-induced strains, enhanced their secondary growth by at least 80%. Surprisingly, this reaction was even greater - relatively - for suppressed trees than for dominant ones. Acclimated trees did not sense the different types of wind events in the same way. Daily wind speed peaks due to thermal winds were filtered out. Thigmomorphogenesis was therefore driven by intense storms.

Forest fires are one of the major environmental concerns, economic, and social in the worldwide. The aim of current research is to identify general indicators influencing on forest fire and compare forest fire susceptibility maps based on the boosted regression tree (BRT), generalized additive model (GAM), and random forest (RF) data mining models in the Minudasht Township, Golestan Province, Iran. According to expert opinion and literature review, fifteen condition factors on forest fire have been selected in the study area. These are slope degree, slope aspect, elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), plan curvature, wind effect, annual temperature and rainfall, soil texture, distance to roads, rivers, and villages, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land use. Forest fire locations were identified using MODIS images, historical records, and extensive field checking. 106 (≈70%) locations, out of 151 forest fires identified, were used for models building/training, while the remaining 45 (≈30%) cases were used for the models validation. BRT, GAM, and RF data mining models were used to distinguish between presence and absence of forest fires and its mapping. These algorithms were used to perform feature selection in order to reveal the variables that contribute more to forest fire occurrence. Finally, for validation of models, the area under the curve (AUC) for forest fire susceptibility maps was calculated. The validation of results showed that AUC for three mentioned models varies from 0.7279 to 0.8770 (AUCBRT = 80.84%, AUCGAM = 87.70%, and AUCRF = 72.79%,). Results indicated that the main drivers of forest fire occurrence were annual rainfall, distance to roads, and land use factors. The results can be applied to primary warning, fire suppression resource planning, and allocation work. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The main objectives of the present study were (1) to determine the association between soil microbial diversity, abundance, and activities with diversity and sustainability of remediated mining-damaged ecosystems in Northern Ontario, and (2) to assess the effects of dolomitic lime applications on aboveground and belowground biodiversity and community structures. Results revealed that liming increases soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), forest tree species diversity and abundance, and the overall ecosystem health even 25 to 35 years after dolomite applications. The mean Shannon index value was significantly higher in limed compared to unlimed sites. Tree species richness was 4.0, 6.0, and 7.7 for unlimed, limed, and reference sites, respectively. Overall, the mean health index revealed a significant improvement in population health in limed sites (index score = 7) compared to unlimed areas (index score = 4). Soil microbial biomass and respiration were also increased by liming. Surprisingly, the main component of soil microbial biomass in limed, unlimed, and reference sites within the vicinity of the restored lands was bacteria (mostly Gram (-). Significant difference was also observed between limed, unlimed, and reference sites for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Gram (-) bacteria, Gram (+) bacteria, anaerobe, and actinomycetes abundance. The ratios between fungi and bacteria and among other phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) measures were extremely low suggesting that the targeted region is still under environmental stress. No apparent associations among soil microbial biomass, soil respiration, and forest plant diversity or abundance were observed. Soil pH levels and organic matter amounts and quality appear to be the main factors affecting these parameters. Molecular analysis of main tree species within the impacted region revealed no change in genetic variation among plant populations on either limed or unlimed lands contaminated with metals over two generations. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","ISSR analysis; Microbial biomass; Plant diversity and abundance; PLFA; Soil liming; Soil respiration","Bacteria; Biodiversity; Biomass; Ecology; Fatty acids; Forestry; Fungi; Genes; Health; Land reclamation; Lime; Nobelium; Phospholipids; Soils; Sustainable development; ISSR analysis; Microbial biomass; Plant diversity; PLFA; Soil liming; Soil respiration; Ecosystems; calcium oxide; fatty acid; metal; organic matter; community structure; dolomite; fatty acid; forest ecosystem; land reclamation; liming; microbial activity; phospholipid; species diversity; Actinobacteria; anaerobe; Article; biodiversity; biomass; breathing; Canada; cation exchange; community structure; controlled study; ecosystem restoration; environmental health; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental reclamation; environmental stress; environmental sustainability; fatty acid analysis; forest management; genetic variability; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; health status; microbial diversity; mining; molecular biology; mycorrhiza; nonhuman; population abundance; scoring system; soil acidity; soil microflora; soil pollution; soil quality; species richness; tree; Canada; Actinobacteria (class); Fungi","Nkongolo, K.K.; Department of Biology, Laurentian UniversityCanada; email: knkongolo@laurentian.ca",,"Springer International Publishing",00496979,,WAPLA,,"English","Water Air Soil Pollut.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961221626

In this study, we tested the effect of ice storm-induced treefall gaps on ground-dwelling beetle assemblages in different-Aged successional stands of subtropical broad-leaved forest in southeastern China. We evaluated the relative importance of gap-phase microhabitat type (within gap, gap edge, and interior shaded) within different stand ages (regenerating stands and mature stands) as determinants of changes in beetle diversity and community structure. At 18 replicate sites sampled during 2009-2010, no significant differences were found in species richness and the abundances of the most common beetle species captured in pitfall traps among the three gap-phase microhabitat types, but the abundances of total beetles, as well as fungivorous and phytophagous species groups, were significantly lower in gap microhabitats than in interior shaded microhabitats in mature stands. Beetle assemblage composition showed no significant differences among the three microhabitat types, and only the fauna of gap plots slightly diverged from those of edge and shaded plots in mature stands. Cover of shrubs and stand age significantly affected beetle assemblage structure. Our results suggest that beetle responses to gap-phase dynamics in early successional forests are generally weak, and that effects are more discernible in the mature stands, perhaps due to the abundance responses of forest-specialist species. © 2015 The Authors 2015.

Monitored deposition data, soil water chemistry data and forest inventory data were compared with the predictions of an integrated ecosystem model, ForSAFE, in an effort to reveal and understand the effects of storms on acidification/recovery in forest soils. Both storms caused windthrow loss leading to increased nitrate and sulphate concentrations in soil water as a result of stimulated mineralization. Lothar led to increased concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, and Cl- in soil water due to sea-salt episode. No general sea-salt episode was seen following Gudrun, but small sea-salt episodes were observed in 2007 and 2008. Each sea-salt episode caused a temporary decrease of pH, and a subsequent recovery, but overall, the soil water pH decreased from 4.54 to 3.86 after Lothar. Modelling suggested that the site was recovering from acidification from 1990s, and would continue to recover in future. Both modelled and monitored data showed that storm caused disturbances in the recovery; monitored data even suggested that soil acidification happened due to storm disturbances. Sea-salt episode does not increase soil acidity in the long term, and will probably decrease the soil acidity by replenishing the base saturation. The modelled data also suggested that storms with only windthrow would not have effects on soil acidification recovery in the long term, but they may influence the soil fertility by losses of base cations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Acidification recovery; Dynamic model; Forest soil; Sea-salt episode; Storm disturbance","Acidification; Dynamic models; Forestry; Plants (botany); Recovery; Soil moisture; Storms; Acidification recovery; Forest inventory data; Forest soils; Integrated ecosystem models; Sea salts; Soil acidifications; Soil water chemistry; Sulphate concentrations; Soils; acidification; comparative study; concentration (composition); coniferous forest; deposition; ecosystem modeling; environmental monitoring; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; forest soil; mineralization; nitrate; sea salt; soil fertility; soil water; spatiotemporal analysis; storm; sulfate; Sweden; Picea abies","Yu, L.; Centre for Environmental and Climate Research, Lund University, Sölvegatan 37, Sweden",,"Elsevier",03043800,,ECMOD,,"English","Ecol.

In the present study selected mist netting parameters have been examined by their effect on catching success for forest dwelling bats: type of stock, net height, capture time, bat activity, net distance from the vegetation and number of capture nights. Besides the known factors of influence, season, weather conditions and local topography, it was possible to show that the selection of the mist netting site, along with a high coverage ratio of vegetation in the mist nettings background and heights of the nets up to eight meters, had a significant influence on the amount of catches.

This study determined the potential vulnerability of forests of Chocó to the loss of plant species in a context of mining activity. Field trips to different mining municipalities of the Chocó region were conducted in order to document the techniques of mineral extraction and the miners’ perception on the performance and the environmental impact of mining in their territories. From data on gold and platinum production (1990-2012), the number of mining titles (2012-2013), number of mines and type of machinery used (2008-2012), the indices of mining activity (IAMAR) and relative mining production (IPMAR) were determined for all the territorial entities of Chocó. Additionally, the number of endemic species and threatened species was estimated and used to calculate the potential floristic vulnerability index (IVFP) regarding loss of species. The IVFP varied significantly between municipalities and subregions of the Chocó territory. The Municipalities with more IVFP were Condoto (9.43%), Istmina (7.75 %), Nóvita (7.74 %), Quibdó (7.64 %) and San José del Palmar (6.56 %). At the subregional level, San Juan (54.8%) had the highest IVFP. Mining in Chocó threats strategic ecosystems of global importance for the conservation of biodiversity and highlights the need for measures to prevent and mitigate the loss of species in areas with high vulnerability due to mining. © 2016, Universidad Austral de Chile.

A simple model of the incentives to hold mining property rights is developed and tested using a unique data-set of small-scale mining property rights data. Econometric techniques are used to test the findings of the model, concluding that the number of mining rights issued fall after election years, with the number rescinded rising. The introduction of REDD+ in Guyana also seems to have increased the number of mining claims being relinquished, and reduce the number being issued. The findings highlight the importance of political economy events in the evolution of small-scale mining activity, and show some evidence that the introduction of a REDD+ framework in Guyana has impacted the main driver of deforestation, despite the absence of specific policy targeting the sector. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Elections; Property Rights; REDD+; Small-scale mining","Economics; Economic activities; Elections; Electoral cycles; Political economy; Property right; REDD; Reducing emissions; Small-scale mining; Deforestation; deforestation; econometrics; economic activity; election; environmental policy; political economy; property rights; small scale mining; Guyana","Laing, T.; Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, London School of Economics and Political ScienceUnited Kingdom",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014207,,,,"English","Resour.

Although land reclamation is a necessary aspect of responsible industrial development, these activities nearly always affect higher order landscape components such as the broader landform, and its hydrology and biogeochemistry. Recent anthropogenic impacts are then believed to result in new environmental conditions and obstacles under which the boreal forest is developing, potentially leading to irreversibly different environments that could be characterized as novel ecosystems. Reflecting an emerging trend across the field of restoration ecology, these novel ecosystems are not necessarily undesirable. Instead, they are an unavoidable consequence of pervading anthropogenic effects on natural ecosystems. It is our view that successful reclamation outcomes can still be derived so long as policy and regulatory requirements are afforded the necessary scope and economic flexibility to account for the development of hybrid and novel ecosystems among highly disturbed mine sites. Hence, this analysis seeks to situate current and anticipated challenges affecting the reclamation of boreal forest following oil sands mining by describing (i) how regulatory criteria shape reclamation practices and targeted end goals and (ii) how these approaches embody latest trends and priorities in the area of restoration ecology. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

Mining is an important economic activity in Brazil, which is often conducted close to forested areas and produces a diffuse noise. In this study, the impact of such noise on biophony (biological sounds) was investigated by characterizing and comparing the soundscapes of two different sites (close versus distant from an open-cast mine) in the same Atlantic forest fragment, matched for habitat type, in Southeast Brazil. Six automated recorders were installed at each site and were programmed to record continuously during seven consecutive days every two months between October 2012 and August 2013. Technophony and biophony values were derived from power spectra and the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI). Mann-Whitney U tests demonstrated that the biophony exhibited a switch in daily dynamics, resulting in a statistically higher biophony during the day at the site close to the mine and a higher biophony during the night at the site far from the mine. Potential species richness was found to be higher at the site that was distant from the mine. The species composition and spectral characteristics of the calls were also found to differ between the two sites. These results provide the first investigation of potential disturbances caused by mining noise on biophony, demonstrating that it can cause alterations in the temporal dynamics and daily patterns of animal sounds, which are symptoms of altered behaviors or variations in community-species composition. These findings suggest remarkable insights that should be taken into consideration in the regulating of the use of natural areas for mining. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic forest; Biophony; Mining activity; Noise disturbance; Technophony","animal; behavioral ecology; communication behavior; environmental disturbance; fragmentation; habitat type; machinery; opencast mining; species richness; technological change; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Animalia","Duarte, M.H.L.; Conservation, Ecology and Animal Behaviour Group - Laboratório de Bioacústica, Mestrado em Zoologia de Vertebrados e Museu de Ciências Naturais, Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais, Rua Dom Jose Gaspar, 290, Bairro Coracao Eucaristico, Brazil; email: marinabioacustica@hotmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",00063207,,BICOB,,"English","Biol.

Box 11365-4563, Tehran, Iran","Dust storms are important phenomena over large regions of the arid and semi-arid areas of the Middle East. Due to the influences of dust aerosols on climate and human daily activities, dust detection plays a crucial role in environmental and climatic studies. Detection of dust storms is critical to accurately understand dust, their properties and distribution. Currently, remotely sensed data such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) with appropriate temporal and spectral resolutions have been widely used for this purpose. This paper investigates the capability of two physical-based methods, and random forests (RF) classifier, for the first time, to detect dust storms using MODIS imagery. Since the physical-based approaches are empirical, they suffer from certain drawbacks such as high variability of thresholds depending on the underlying surface. Therefore, classification-based approaches could be deployed as an alternative. In this paper, the most relevant bands are chosen based on the physical effects of the major classes, particularly dust, cloud and snow, on both emissive infrared and reflective bands. In order to verify the capability of the methods, OMAERUV AAOD (aerosol absorption optical depth) product from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) sensor is exploited. In addition, some small regions are selected manually to be considered as ground truth for measuring the probability of false detection (POFD) and probability of missing detection (POMD). The dust class generated by RF is consistent qualitatively with the location and extent of dust observed in OMERAUV and MODIS true colour images. Quantitatively, the dust classes generated for eight dust outbreaks in the Middle East are found to be accurate from 7% and 6% of POFD and POMD respectively. Moreover, results demonstrate the sound capability of RF in classifying dust plumes over both water and land simultaneously. The performance of the physical-based approaches is found weaker than RF due to empirical thresholds that are not always true. © Indian Academy of Sciences.","Decision tree; Dust detection; MODIS; Random forests","atmospheric plume; detection method; dust storm; image classification; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Middle East","Souri, A.H.; Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of HoustonUnited States; email: asouri@uh.edu",,"Indian Academy of Sciences",02534126,,,,"English","J.

This study investigated temporal variations in DOM during four storm events in two forest headwater streams (the EH and JH brooks, South Korea) and the impacts on the disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formation potential. The within-event variations of most DOM quantity parameters were similar to the flow rate in the EH but not in the larger JH brook. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis with the flow rate in the EH and JH brooks, respectively, indicating the importance of both flow path and DOM source pool size in determining the effects of storm events. The stream DOM became less aromatic/humified from the first to the last event in both brooks, probably due to the increasing fresh plant pool and the decreasing leaf litter pool during the course of rainy season. The DOC export during each event increased 1.3–2.7- and 1.1–7.0-fold by stormflows in the EH and JH brooks, respectively. The leaf litter and soil together was the major DOM source, particularly during early events. The enhanced DOM export probably increases the risks of DBPs formation in disinfection, as indicated by a strong correlation observed between DOC and trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP). High correlations between two humic-like fluorescent components and THMFP further suggested the potential of assessing THMFP with in situ fluorescence sensors during storms. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Disinfection byproducts; Dissolved organic carbon; Fluorescence spectroscopy; PARAFAC; River; Storms","aquatic ecosystem; disinfection; dissolved inorganic matter; drinking water; fluorescence; headwater; river water; disinfectant agent; ground water; humic substance; soil; trihalomethane; water pollutant; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; forest; humic substance; river; soil; South Korea; water pollutant; water quality; weather; weed; Disinfectants; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Groundwater; Humic Substances; Plant Weeds; Republic of Korea; Rivers; Soil; Trihalomethanes; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality; Weather","Hur, J.; Department of Environment & Energy, Sejong UniversitySouth Korea",,"Springer Verlag",09441344,,ESPLE,"25586618","English","Environ.

Statistical analysis demonstrated that increasing tree height and local wind speed during the storm were the main factors associated with increased damage levels. All models provided acceptable discrimination between damaged and undamaged forest stands but there were trade-offs between the accuracy of the mechanistic models and model bias.

Water samples were collected from storm events pre- (PWR), during (DWR) and after windrowing (AWR). Total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total ammonia, nitrate, stream discharge, water level and velocity were measured. Results showed that peak and flow weighted mean concentrations (FWMC) of TSS concentrations increased significantly during windrowing when compared to pre-windrowing concentrations. Peak TSS increased from 88mg/l (PWR) to 502mg/l (DWR) and decreased to 163mg/l (one year AWR) and 225mg/l (two years AWR). Peak and FWMC of TP also increased during windrowing when compared to pre-windrowing concentrations. Peak TP concentrations increased from 0.1mg/l (PWR) to 0.4mg/l (DWR) and decreased to 0.1mg/l (AWR). SRP and nitrate concentrations increased during windrowing when compared to pre-windrowing but remained low overall. TSS and TP concentrations were highest when flows greater than 0.3m3/s (exceeded 6.3% of time) were recorded in the channel. It was highlighted that high-resolution sampling of storm events is important, where precise measurements of windrowing-sourced outputs are required. Windrowing was shown to generate very high concentrations of TSS and TP, comparable to those recorded during harvesting. This research helps to identify potential impacts on physico-chemical water quality that arise during windrowing and demonstrates the need for measures to minimize impacts on surface waters as required by the EU Water Framework Directive and similar legislation elsewhere. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Forest operations; Phosphorus; Physical water quality; Sediment; Windrowing","Catchments; Environmental regulations; Forestry; Harvesting; Importance sampling; Laws and legislation; Nitrates; Phosphorus; Sediments; Storms; Water conservation; Water levels; Water quality; Eu-water framework directives; Forest operation; High resolution sampling; Nitrate concentration; Physico-chemical water qualities; Soluble reactive phosphorus; Total suspended solids; Windrowing; Hydrochemistry; ammonia; nitrate; phosphorus; rain; soluble reactive phosphorus; unclassified drug; ammonia; concentration (composition); discharge; forestry practice; headwater; nitrate; phosphorus; physicochemical property; regulatory framework; sediment; water level; water quality; agricultural procedures; air temperature; Article; catchment; comparative study; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental parameters; forest windrowing; forestry; harvesting; Ireland; nitrogen loading; phosphorus loading; physical chemistry; sediment; suspended particulate matter; water analysis; water flow; water quality; water sampling; Forests; Phosphorus; Sediments; Water Quality; Ireland","Clarke, J.; UCD Dooge Centre for Water Resources Research, UCD School of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering, Newstead, University College DublinIreland",,"Elsevier",00489697,,STEVA,,"English","Sci.

While the model of disturbance probability correctly classified 90 % of all cases in the data set (specificity 95 %, sensitivity 26 %), the model for damage intensity explained only low percentages of the variation in the observed damage data (full model R2 = 0.38, fixed effects-only model R2 = 0.09; cross-validation in the four forest management units yielded similar R2 values). • Conclusion: The developed models indicated that decreasing the proportion of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst), limiting stand age and reducing the timber stock in course of tending treatments in stands exposed to wind disturbance can mitigate the risk and the expected damage intensity. High gust speeds and salvage cuts after earlier damage increase the probability of further wind disturbance events. © 2014, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.","Disturbance; Forest management; Risk; Stand scale; Storm; Windthrow","coniferous tree; environmental disturbance; environmental impact assessment; forest management; model test; prediction; risk assessment; site effect; storm damage; timber; windthrow; Austria; Picea abies","Pasztor, F.; Institute of Silviculture, Department of Forest and Soil Sciences, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU) Vienna, Peter-Jordan Straße 82, Austria",,"Springer-Verlag France",12864560,,AFOSF,,"English","Ann.

New interest in ridge-top mining has raised concerns about possible waterway impacts. We examined effects of forestry, mining, and road construction-based disturbance on physico-chemistry and macroinvertebrate communities in east-central Tennessee headwater streams. Although 11 of 30 sites failed Tennessee’s biocriteria scoring system, invertebrate richness was moderately high and we did not find significant differences in any water chemistry or habitat parameters between sites with passing and failing scores. However, conductivity and dissolved solid concentrations appeared elevated in the majority of study streams. Principal components (PCs) analysis indicated that six PCs accounted for ~77 % of among-site habitat variability. One PC associated with dissolved oxygen and specific conductance explained the second highest proportion of among-site variability after catchment area. Specific conductance was not correlated with catchment area but was strongly correlated with mining activity. Composition and success of multivariate models using habitat PCs to predict macroinvertebrate metrics was highly variable. PC scores associated with water chemistry and substrate composition were most frequently included in significant models. These results suggest that impacts of historical and current coal mining remain a source of water quality and macroinvertebrate community impairment in this region, but effects are subtle. Our results suggest that surface mining may have chronic and system-wide effects on habitat conditions and invertebrate communities in Cumberland Plateau streams. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Benthos; Coal; Conductivity; Fine sediment; pH; Surface mine","Biochemical oxygen demand; Catchments; Coal; Coal mines; Dissolved oxygen; Ecosystems; Electric conductivity; Forestry; Hydrochemistry; Microcomputers; Mining; pH; Principal component analysis; Road construction; Roads and streets; Runoff; Timber; Water quality; Appalachian mountains; Benthos; Fine sediments; Invertebrate communities; Macroinvertebrate community; Stream invertebrates; Substrate composition; Surface mines; Rivers; dissolved oxygen; water pollutant; Article; catchment; Chironomidae; coal mining; conductance; construction work; Ephemeroptera; flow rate; forestry; invertebrate; land use; macroinvertebrate; nonhuman; Oligochaeta; physical chemistry; principal component analysis; railway; scoring system; surface mining; turbidity; United States; water quality; analysis; animal; coal mining; ecosystem; electric conductivity; environmental monitoring; forestry; growth, development and aging; procedures; river; standards; statistics and numerical data; water pollutant; Animals; Coal Mining; Ecosystem; Electric Conductivity; Environmental Monitoring; Forestry; Invertebrates; Principal Component Analysis; Rivers; Tennessee; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality","Gangloff, M.M.; Biology Department, Appalachian State University, 572 Rivers Street, United States",,"Springer New York LLC",0364152X,,EMNGD,"25528595","English","Environ.

The Coquimbo Region has suffered serious soil and water pollution because of heavy metals from mining, particularly copper. Implementation of measures that help to minimize the environmental impact of mining tailings requires knowledge about the adaptability of vegetal species to degraded soil conditions. Our objective was to determine and compare the phytostabilization abilities of native and exotic shrub species in areas extremely damaged by mining activities in the Coquimbo Region. The survival growth, and canopy development rates of 20 species were evaluated by two experiments. The Cu quantity in stems and leaves and at three soil depths was measured. Our results indicated that Acacia saligna is the best species in accumulating heavy metals (average of 34.8 ppm in leaves and 12.3 ppm in stems, both for non-fertilized soils), while demonstrating average survival rates over 80 %. This study concludes that A. saligna is the best species for phytostabilization activities in mine tailings of the Coquimbo Region.","Land degradation; Mine tailings; Phytoremediation; Phytostabilization; Phytotoxicity; Soil management",,"Valdés-Pineda, R.; University of Arizona, Department of Hydrology and Water Resources, 1133 E James E.

An approach to evaluate comparatively the multiple relationships between biophysical variables and socioeconomic factors is illustrated in the present study using the data collected from 586 field sites located in five Mediterranean areas (Spain, Greece, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco). A total of 47 variables were chosen to illustrate land-use, farm characteristics, population pressure, tourism development, rainfall regime, water availability, soil properties and vegetation cover, among others. A data mining approach incorporating non-parametric inference, principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering was developed to identify candidate syndromes of soil degradation and desertification risk. While field sites in the same study area showed a substantial similarity, the multivariate relationship among variables diverged among study areas. Data mining techniques proved to be a practical tool to identify spatial determinants of soil degradation and desertification risk.

On the basis of 89 windthrow gaps, we quantified natural tree regeneration 10 and 20years after wind disturbance, and identified the factors influencing tree regeneration dynamics, with a special emphasis on the post-storm management practices ""salvage logging"" and ""no intervention"". The sample encompasses gaps of ≥3ha and total overstory mortality caused by wind disturbance. The gaps date back to the two catastrophic storm events Vivian in 1990 and Lothar in 1999. Gaps covered an ecologically diverse region extending over 20,000km2 and ranging from 370 to 1780ma.s.l. on the Central Plateau and in the Alps of Switzerland (Central Europe). Regeneration status was assessed on six circular sample plots per windthrow gap in 2010/2011. We recorded soil pH, organic layer, post-windthrow treatment, elevation, aspect, slope, browsing damage, and presence of predominant vegetation cover. We compared regeneration density and composition in gaps with and without salvage logging and elucidated the most important environmental factors influencing tree regeneration after wind disturbance using generalized linear models (GLMs). Ten and twenty years after wind disturbance, late-successional tree species such as beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.

Samples of fine-grained sediment were collected monthly during the snow-free season in 2008 using time-integrated samplers at replicate sites representative of agriculture, forestry and mining activities in the basin (i.e. ""impacted"" sites). Samples were also collected from replicate reference sites and also from the main stem of the Quesnel River at the downstream confluence with the Fraser River. Generally, metal(loid) and phosphorus (P) concentrations for ""impacted"" sites were greater than for reference sites. Furthermore, concentrations of copper (forestry and mining sites), manganese (agriculture and forestry sites) and selenium (agriculture, forestry and mining sites) exceeded upper sediment quality guideline (SQG) thresholds. These results suggest that agriculture, forestry and metal mining activities are having an influence on the concentrations of sediment-associated metal(loid)s and P in the Quesnel basin.Metal(loid) and P concentrations of sediment collected from the downstream site were not significantly greater than values for the reference sites, and were typically lower than the values for the impacted sites. This suggests that the cumulative effects of agriculture, forestry and mining activities in the QRB are presently not having a measureable effect at the river basin-scale. The lack of a cumulative effect at the basin-scale is thought to reflect: (i) the relatively recent occurrence of land use disturbances in this basin; (ii) the dominance of sediment contributions from natural forest and agriculture; and (iii) the potential for storage of contaminants on floodplains and other storage elements between the locations of disturbance activities and the downstream sampling site, which may be attenuating the disturbance signal. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Contaminants; Cumulative effects; Environmental stressors; Metals and metalloids; Sediment and water quality; Suspended sediment","Suspended sediments; British Columbia , Canada; Cumulative effects; Environmental stressors; Fine-grained sediment; Metal mining; Metals and metalloids; Phosphorus contents; River basins; Impurities; aluminum; copper; manganese; metal; phosphorus; selenium; metal; phosphorus; water pollutant; agriculture; anthropogenic effect; fine grained sediment; forestry; metal; mining; phosphorus; sediment pollution; suspended sediment; ; agriculture; Article; Canada; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental parameters; environmental stress; forestry; human impact (environment); land use; mining; river basin; sediment; sediment quality; stream (river); water quality; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; river; water pollutant; British Columbia; Canada; Fraser River; Quesnel Basin; Agriculture; British Columbia; Environmental Monitoring; Forestry; Geologic Sediments; Metals; Mining; Phosphorus; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Owens, P.N.; University of Northern British Columbia, 3333 University WayCanada",,"Elsevier",00489697,,STEVA,"25105754","English","Sci.

Information on growing stock is thus essential to understand dynamics of forest stands, their productive capacity and to manage their use within limits of sustainability. Dynamic changes of forest growing stock, as well as predictions of their future development, are usually estimated from the data gathered by national forest inventories using some mechanistic modelling approach. The resulting models are informative, but include many parameters, some of which are difficult to set or estimate. Due to the demanding parameterisation of mechanistic models, it is hard to achieve stability of their output accuracy, which can lower their predictive power. This paper presents an alternative and complementary approach of constructing models with machine learning and data mining methods. We applied these methods to the Silva-SI database and used the resulting interpretable models in order to find explanations for structural changes in Slovenian forests over the period from year 1970 to 2010. In addition, we developed predictive models for growing sock in the decade from year 2010 to 2020. The structure of the models describing temporal dynamics of growing stock shows that trends of growing stock are increasing for the entire studied period, while accumulation of growing stock is much more intensive after 1990. Forests with a lower growing stock are located either in the areas with non-favorable site conditions for forest growth, or at lower altitudes, where they are more exposed to human exploitation due to their vicinity to more densely populated regions. Predictions of growing stock for the decade 2010-2020 suggest that Slovenian forests will continue to accumulate their growing stock (private owned forests to 327 m3/ha and state owned forests to 343 m3/ha in 2020). The presented data mining approach that was here applied to the growing stock can also be used for investigating other ecological indicators. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Data mining; Ecological indicator; Forest growing stock; Forest inventory data; Trend prediction",,"Debeljak, M.Jamova Cesta 39, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; email: marko.debeljak@ijs.si",,,1470160X,,,,"English","Ecol.

In order to gain a broader understanding of the specific effects of aeolian disturbance on soils in this region, research was conducted to evaluate soil microbial respiration and nitrogen mineralization in places where differences in microtopography occur due to the uprooting of trees by windthrow events, thereby causing variations in microtopography hereby referred to as ""pit-mound positions"".A twenty-hectare study site situated within the Tarbiat Modares University Experimental Forest Station located in the Mazandaran province of northern Iran was chosen for this research, with thirty-four uprooted trees selected for detailed study. A classification of five microsites was developed to distinguish differences in microtopography in the immediate vicinity of these uprooted trees: mound top, mound wall, pit bottom, pit wall and closed canopy. Soil was sampled in the 0-15, 15-30 and 30-45cm depths at all microsites using a core soil sampler with an 81cm2 cross section. Soil reaction, organic carbon, total nitrogen, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, moisture, abundance and biomass of earthworms, soil microbial respiration and net N mineralization for all samples were measured in the laboratory.Statistical comparisons revealed that the highest soil microbial respiration and net N-mineralization occurred in pit bottoms. Mound tops showed the lowest levels of soil microbial respiration and net N mineralization. Measurements of soil microbial respiration and net N mineralization were shown to decrease in relation to increased soil depth, with significant differences depending on soil depth. Indications of aeolian processes indicate that windthrow events create different microsites, thereby influencing the specific micro-scale soil characteristics. These micro-scale characteristics should be taken into account when performing forest soils surveys and to inform forest management practices. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Disturbances; Iran; Microbial respiration; Nitrogen mineralization; Pit and mound; Soil chemistry","biochemistry; environmental disturbance; eolian process; forest management; forest soil; land degradation; microtopography; mineralization; montane forest; soil chemistry; soil microorganism; soil property; soil survey; windthrow; Iran","Kooch, Y.; Department of Forestry, Faculty of Natural Resources and Marine Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Noor, Mazandaran, Iran; email: yahya.kooch@yahoo.com",,,03418162,,CIJPD,,"English","Catena",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893437585

We have assessed fire severity using differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) from Landsat imagery in 15 historical wildfires of Pinus halepensis Mill. We have considered a wide range of innovative topographic, fuel and fire behavior variables with the purposes of (1) determining the variables that influence fire severity patterns among fires (considering the 15 wildfires together) and (2) ascertaining whether different variables affect extreme fire severity within the three fire types (topographic, convective and wind-driven fires). The among-fires analysis showed that fires in less arid climates and with steeper slopes had more extreme severity. In less arid conditions there was more crown fuel accumulation and closer forest structures, promoting high vertical and horizontal fuel continuity and extreme fire severity. The analyses carried out for each fire separately (within fires) showed more extreme fire severity in areas in northern aspects, with steeper slopes, with high crown biomass and in climates with more water availability. In northern aspects solar radiation was lower and fuels had less water limitation to growth which, combined with steeper slopes, produced more extreme severity. In topographic fires there was more extreme severity in northern aspects with steeper slopes and in areas with more water availability and high crown biomass; in convection-dominated fires there was also more extreme fire severity in northern aspects with high biomass; while in wind-driven fires there was only a slight interaction between biomass and water availability. This latter pattern could be related to the fact that wind-driven fires spread with high wind speed, which could have minimized the effect of other variables. In the future, and as a consequence of climate change, new zones with high crown biomass accumulated in non-common drought areas will be available to burn as extreme severity wildfires. © 2014 Lecina-Diaz et al.",,"fuel; article; biomass; climate change; drought; environmental parameters; fire ecology; fogo selvagem; forest; geographic distribution; pine; Pinus halepensis; solar radiation; thermodynamics; topography; water availability; wind; altitude; climate; ecosystem; fire; geography; physiology; Spain; wind; Altitude; Biomass; Climate; Droughts; Ecosystem; Fires; Forests; Geography; Pinus; Spain; Wind",,,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,"24465492","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899790802

In recent years, disturbance frequency and severity have been increasing at continental scale, a trend that is expected to continue under future anthropogenic climate change. Disturbance management is thus increasingly important for sustainable stewardship of forests, and requires tools to evaluate the effects of management alternatives and climatic changes on disturbance risk and ecosystem services. We here present a process-based model of wind disturbance impacts on forest ecosystems, integrated into the dynamic landscape simulation model iLand. The model operates at the level of individual trees and simulates wind disturbance events iteratively, i.e., dynamically accounting for changes in forest structure and newly created edges during the course of a storm. Both upwind gap size and local shelter from neighboring trees are considered in this regard, and critical wind speeds for uprooting and stem breakage are distinguished. The simulated disturbance size, pattern, and severity are thus emergent properties of the model. We evaluated the new simulation tool against satellite-derived data on the impact of the storm Gudrun (January 2005) on a 1391ha forest landscape in south central Sweden. Both the overall damage percentage (observation: 21.7%, simulation: 21.4%) as well as the comparison of spatial damage patterns showed good correspondence between observations and predictions (prediction accuracy: 60.4%) if the full satellite-derived structural and spatial heterogeneity of the landscape was taken into account. Neglecting within-stand heterogeneity in forest conditions, i.e., the state-of-the-art in many stand-level risk models, resulted in a considerable underestimation of simulated damage, supporting the notion that tree-level complexity matters for assessing and modeling large-scale disturbances. A sensitivity analysis further showed that changes in wind speed and soil freezing could have potentially large impacts on disturbed area and patch size. The model presented here is available as open source. It can be used to study the effects of different silvicultural systems and future climates on wind risk, as well as to quantify the impacts of wind disturbance on ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. It thus contributes to improving our capacity to address changing disturbance regimes in ecosystem management. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Ecosystem heterogeneity; Forest disturbance; ILand; Landscape modeling; Wind model; Windthrow","Forest disturbances; ILand; Landscape model; Wind modeling; Windthrows; Climate change; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Risk assessment; Soil mechanics; Storms; Forestry; anthropogenic effect; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; environmental disturbance; environmental modeling; forest ecosystem; gap dynamics; heterogeneity; landscape; numerical model; patch size; risk assessment; satellite data; storm damage; wind velocity; windthrow; Ecosystems; Forestry; Risk Assessment; Simulation; Sweden","Seidl, R.; Institute of Silviculture, Department of Forest- and Soil Sciences, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU), Vienna, Austria; email: rupert.seidl@boku.ac.at",,,13648152,,EMSOF,,"English","Environ.

In recent decades, large tracts of northeastern boreal forest of Canada have been affected by different types of climatic events causing a lot of partial and some total stand mortality. Since these disturbances may become more important drivers of forest dynamics, there is a need to document their impact on forest structure. The objectives of this study were to describe temporal dynamics of partial windthrows and determine the effect of partial windthrow on stand composition and understory vegetation. The study was conducted in the North-Shore region of Quebec (Canada). Eighteen plots in closed forests were paired with 18 adjacent windthrow areas, in which trees experienced similar edaphic and climatic conditions. Dendroecological analyses, combined with vegetation sampling, were conducted on each site to determine stand structure and vegetation development through time. Significant increases in balsam fir and shade-tolerant species were observed in windthrow gaps. Tree mortality in windthrown stands was a slow process until the mid-1990s, a period during which spruce budworm defoliation may have played a role in weakening trees and making them more vulnerable to partial windthrow. Greater mortality observed following the mid-1990s was most certainly related to a regional storm. The initial composition of stands plays an important role in driving postwindthrow succession, as balsam fir is more susceptible to treefall. As opposed to stand-replacing windthrow and spruce budworm outbreaks that generate various postdisturbance responses, partial windthrow appears to only create opportunities for pre-established balsam fir to undergo release in gaps. © 2014, National Research Council of Canada.

We analysed ecological changes between 1971 and 2002 in 143 200-m2 plots in 10 woodland sites exposed to the storm with an ecologically equivalent sample of 150 plots in 16 non-exposed sites. Comparing both years, understorey plant species-richness, species composition, soil pH and woody basal area of the tree and shrub canopy were measured. We tested the hypothesis that the storm had deflected sites from the wider national trajectory of an increase in woody basal area and reduced understorey species-richness associated with ageing canopies and declining woodland management. We also expected storm disturbance to amplify the background trend of increasing soil pH, a UK-wide response to reduced atmospheric sulphur deposition. Path analysis was used to quantify indirect effects of storm exposure on understorey species richness via changes in woody basal area and soil pH. By 2002, storm exposure was estimated to have increased mean species richness per 200 m2 by 32%. Woody basal area changes were highly variable and did not significantly differ with storm exposure. Increasing soil pH was associated with a 7% increase in richness. There was no evidence that soil pH increased more as a function of storm exposure. Changes in species richness and basal area were negatively correlated: a 3.4% decrease in richness occurred for every 0.1-m2 increase in woody basal area per plot. Despite all sites substantially exceeding the empirical critical load for nitrogen deposition, there was no evidence that in the 15 years since the storm, disturbance had triggered a eutrophication effect associated with dominance of gaps by nitrophilous species. Synthesis. Although the impacts of the 1987 storm were spatially variable in terms of impacts on woody basal area, the storm had a positive effect on understorey species richness. There was no evidence that disturbance had increased dominance of gaps by invasive species. This could change if recovery from acidification results in a soil pH regime associated with greater macronutrient availability. © 2014 British Ecological Society.","Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling; Biodiversity; Extreme weather; Global change; Land-use; Mixed models; Path analysis; Plant traits; Resilience","basal area; Bayesian analysis; broad-leaved forest; climate effect; dominance; ecological modeling; ecosystem resilience; environmental disturbance; eutrophication; extreme event; gap dynamics; global change; plant community; soil profile; species diversity; storm; succession; temperate forest; understory; woodland; United Kingdom","Smart, S.M.; NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster, LA1 4AP, United Kingdom; email: ssma@ceh.ac.uk",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00220477,,JECOA,,"English","J.

Forest ecosystems face global environmental pressures from timber exploitation to genetic pollution and climate change, and it is therefore essential to comprehend how disturbances may alter the dispersal of genes and their establishment in tree populations in order to formulate relevant recommendations for sustainable resource management practices and realistic predictions of potential adaptation to climate change by means of range shift or expansion (Kremer et al.). However, obtaining reliable evidence of disturbance-induced effects on gene dispersal processes from empirical evaluation of forest tree populations is difficult. Indeed, tree species share characteristics such as high longevity, long generation time and large reproductive population size, which may impede the experimenter's ability to assess parameters at the spatial and time scales at which any change may occur (Petit and Hampe). It has been suggested that appropriate study designs should encompass comparison of populations before and after disturbance as well as account for demonstrated variation in conspecific density, that is, the spatial distribution of mates, and forest density, including all species and relating to alteration in landscape openness (Bacles & Jump). However, more often than not, empirical studies aiming to assess the consequences of habitat disturbance on genetic processes in tree populations assume rather than quantify a change in tree densities in forests under disturbance and generally fail to account for population history, which may lead to inappropriate interpretation of a causal relationship between population genetic structure and habitat disturbance due to effects of unmonitored confounding variables (Gauzere et al.). In this issue, Shohami and Nathan () take advantage of the distinctive features of the fire-adapted wind-pollinated Aleppo pine Pinus halepensis (Fig.) to provide an elegant example of best practice. Thanks to long-term monitoring of the study site, a natural stand in Israel, Shohami and Nathan witnessed the direct impact of habitat disturbance, here taking the shape of fire, on conspecific and forest densities and compared pre- and postdisturbance mating patterns estimated from cones of different ages sampled on the same surviving maternal individuals (Fig.). This excellent study design is all the more strong that Shohami and Nathan took further analytical steps to account for confounding variables, such as historical population genetic structure and possible interannual variation in wind conditions, thus giving high credibility to their findings of unequivocal fire-induced alteration of mating patterns in P. halepensis. Most notably, the authors found, at the pollen pool level, a disruption of local genetic structure which, furthermore, they were able to attribute explicitly to enhanced pollen-mediated gene immigration into the low-density fire-disturbed stand. This cleverly designed research provides a model approach to be followed if we are to advance our understanding of disturbance-induced dispersal and genetic change in forest trees. These old serotinous cones stayed closed during a fire in a natural population of Aleppo pine, Pinus halepensis in Israel, providing a window into the past to assess prefire mating patterns of surviving trees and effective pollen dispersal within and outside the stand before habitat disturbance occurred.

Applied here in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP) in southeastern Germany, this approach detected even small changes between two data takes, thus, facilitating documentation of regular management activities. In the case of a sudden event, forest cover databases also serve as a baseline for damage assessment. A storm event, which occurred on 13 July, 2011, provided the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of multi-seasonal RE data for rapid damage assessment. Images of sufficient quality (<20% cloud cover) acquired one day before the storm event were used as a baseline. Persistent cloud cover meant that the first ""after event"" image of sufficient quality was acquired six weeks later, on 22 August, 2011. Aerial images (AI) for the official damage assessment done by the BFNP administration were acquired on that same day. The RE analysis for damage assessment was completed two weeks after the post-event data take with an overall accuracy of 96% and a kappa coefficient of 0.86. In contrast, the official aerial image survey from the BFNP was first released in late November, eleven weeks later. Comparison of the results from the two analyses showed a difference in the detected amount of forest cover loss of only 3%. The estimated cost of the RE approach was four times less than that of the standard digital AI procedure employed by the BFNP. © 2014 by the authors.","Aerial images; Forest cover monitoring; Multi-seasonal; RapidEye; Storm damage","Damage detection; Database systems; Storms; Aerial images; Forest cover; Multi-seasonal; Rapideye; Storm damage; Forestry; accuracy assessment; aerial survey; database; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; forest cover; forest management; satellite data; seasonality; storm damage; Data Bases; Forestry; Hazards; Remote Sensing; Bavaria; Bavarian Forest National Park; Germany; Scolytinae","Elatawneh, A.; Institute of Forest Management, Center of Life and Food Sciences Weihenstephan, Technische Universität München, Hans-Carl-von-Carlowitz-Platz 2, Freising 85354, Germany; email: alataaa@tum.de",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902441344

We investigated the characterisation and impact of these mining activities and associated forestry in the Argentière (L'Argentière-La Bessée) and Faravel (Freissinières) districts using a multidisciplinary approach that includes archaeological, palynological, geochemical, anthracological and dendrochronological studies applied to mining remnants and a peat bog (Fangeas, in the Faravel district). More specifically, we studied the occurrence of lead contamination episodes, the chronology of mining activities and their link to the evolution in woodland cover. Our chronology is based on mining archaeology, radiocarbon dating of about thirty charcoal samples and the dendrochronological analysis of more than 170 specimens of exhumed waterlogged wood. The anthracological analysis was established with more than 10,000 charcoals from firesetting. The main geochemical approach was based on the analysis of lead and its stable isotopes in sediment fractions from a peat core. The combination of palynological records and lead isotope imprints were used to characterise (i) a Roman contamination episode unknown to archaeology, (ii) the development of medieval mining activities and (iii) the reactivation of mining during the Modern period and the Industrial Revolution. Medieval mining coincides with an extension of the high mountain agropastoral areas. The in situ continuous human activities in the same industrial territory led to rational communal management of subalpine forests, but also to their parcelling that reached its peak in the High Middle Ages. Mining during the Modern period coincides with significant stress on woodland areas that also appears to be related to lumber and fuel timber production for shipyards (French Royal Navy) as well as the functioning of several military fortresses. The mining reactivation during the 19th c. matched public measures of forest protection that took shape in the afforestation programme of the uplands. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Forestry; French Southern Alps; Holocene; Lead isotopes; Mining; Pollen and charcoal","archaeological evidence; charcoal; dendrochronology; forestry; Holocene; interdisciplinary approach; lead isotope; Medieval; mining; palynology; peatland; radiocarbon dating; Roman era; silver; Durance Valley; France; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur","Py, V.; GEODE, UMR 5602, CNRS, Université Toulouse-Jean Jaurés, Maison de la Recherche, 5 Allée Antonio Machado, France",,"Elsevier Ltd",10406182,,,,"English","Quat.

Quantification of extreme climate event effects on carbon and water exchanges of forests can improve our understanding of the feedbacks between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere in the context of global change. This study analyzes the impacts of the early 2008 ice storm that occurred in southeastern China. The impacts on the Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Evapotranspiration (ET) of Moso bamboo forests were analyzed using ecosystem models, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and Eddy Covariance flux tower measurements. Interannual differences in GPP and ET were divided into three parts: (1) environmental-dependent, (2) biophysical-dependent, and (3) ice storm damage-dependent. Our results showed that the GPP and ET of Moso bamboo forests were accurately predicted using the remote sensing-driven Penman-Monteith (RS-PM) and Eddy Covariance Light Use Efficiency (EC-LUE) models, respectively. The early 2008 ice storm caused a slight decrease in annual ET and GPP, mainly during the ice storm. Plant transpiration had a slight decrease, but soil (background) evaporation increased because of the reduction in Leaf Area Index (LAI) caused by ice storm effects. This ice storm decreased annual mean GPP by 0.17 g C m-2 d-1 (roughly 3% of average GPP in 2008) since the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) approached to zero because of ice and snow cover effects. Ice storm damage effects on ET and GPP for the off-year (the year with few new shoot production) were slightly greater than those for the on-year (the year with many new shoot production) due to their different growth characteristics. The time for bamboo forest recovery (1-years) from ice storm damage was quite short. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem models; Evapotranspiration; Gross Primary Production; Ice storm damages; Moso bamboo forests","Phyllostachys pubescens","Zhou, G.; Zhejiang A and F University, 88# Huancheng North Road, China; email: zhougm@zafu.edu.cn",,"Elsevier B.V.",01681923,,AFMEE,,"English","Agric.

The importance of disturbances in forest dynamics is unquestioned, and the size of the disturbed area (size of gap) is the most common way of differentiating disturbances. But few studies have examined other disturbance characteristics to see if small and large disturbances are different. In northern hardwoods forests of northwestern Pennsylvania, a 2003 windstorm event created windthrow gaps ranging in size from 0.1. ha to >100. ha, allowing comparisons across a broad size spectrum, yet with similar species composition, soils, climate, and topography. We selected 17 gaps, ranging in size from 0.05 to 4.0. ha, to compare damage characteristics across a size spectrum. Disturbance severity (both proportion of trees fallen, and proportion of basal area fallen) increased significantly with gap size. Similarity in floristic composition between pre- and post-disturbance stands, decreased with increasing gap size. Larger gaps also caused greater reduction in mean size (diameter) of remaining trees. As expected, larger gaps resulted in greater canopy openness, but canopy openness was significantly influenced by both gap size and severity of canopy disturbance. These findings demonstrate that disturbance size and severity covary in northern hardwood windthrow gaps. Moreover, because of nonrandom impacts across species and size classes, immediate changes in size structure and composition of affected stands were greater in larger gaps.

The study focused on the impact of these disturbances and forestry practices on collembolan community distribution and structure 4 years after the disturbance. Four different treatments were selected for this study: intact forest stands (REF), non-extracted windthrown stands (NEX), clear-cut windthrown stands (EXT) and burnt windthrown stands (FIR). From a total of 7,820 individuals, 72 species were identified. The highest total abundance mean was recorded in FIR stands followed by NEX and EXT stands and, surprisingly, the lowest in REF stands. The highest total species richness was observed in REF stands, followed by NEX stands and FIR stands and the lowest in EXT stands. In REF and NEX stands, the most abundant species were Folsomia penicula and Tetracanthella fjellbergi, while in heavily damaged stands, the most abundant was Anurophorus laricis. The ordination method used demonstrated a significant influence of treatment on the abundance of Collembola. ANOVA used confirmed significant differences for all dominant species between treatments. The present study shows the negative impact of windthrow on Collembola communities as reflected in decreased species richness and abundance. However, disturbance by fire caused a considerable increase in collembolan abundance 3 years after the event. Moreover, we show that clearing of windthrown spruce forests after a windstorm is less favourable for communities of soil collembolans and slows down the recovery process. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Clearing; Collembola; Disturbance; High Tatra Mts; Wildfire; Windthrow","Clearing; Collembola; Disturbance; High Tatra Mts; Wildfire; Windthrows; Fires; Timber; Forestry; abundance; arthropod; community structure; environmental disturbance; forestry practice; species richness; wildfire; windthrow; animal experiment; Anurophorus laricis; article; Collembola; community structure; controlled study; environmental monitoring; Folsomia penicula; forestry; nonhuman; population abundance; Slovakia; soil analysis; species distribution; species diversity; species identification; species richness; Tetracanthella fjellbergi; Animals; Arthropods; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; Forestry; Picea; Risk Assessment; Slovakia; Soil; Analysis Of Variance; Biodiversity; Forest Fires; Slovakia; Carpathians; Slovakia; Tatra Mountains; Tatras National Park; Anurophorus laricis; Collembola; Folsomia penicula; Picea; Tetracanthella","Čuchta, P.; Institute of Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Science, P.

This paper provides an integrative overview of the nature, contributing factors and impacts of wind-caused disturbance in forests, including its effects on trees, stands, landscapes and soils. Windthrow is examined through the integrating concepts of: the capacity of trees for acclimative growth, the limitation of acclimative growth under inter-tree competition, the recurrent nature of severe weather, how terrain and soil conditions affect local stand vulnerability and the effect of recurrent windthrow on stand dynamics and soils. Windthrow management should take place within a framework of general risk management, with evaluation of the likelihood, severity and potential impacts of wind damage considered - with reference to the broad and specific aims of management. There is much to be gained from interdisciplinary communication about the nature and consequences of recurrent wind damage. There are opportunities for climatologists, engineers, ecologists, geomorphologists and others to develop integrative process models at the tree, stand and landscape scales that will improve our collective understanding, and inform management decision-making. © Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2012.

Here, we evaluate the short-term effects of a heavy snowfall and strong winds on three long-lived species of forest-dwelling raptor in a semi-arid Mediterranean region situated in the south-east of Spain. The loss of nests was significantly higher in the first and second years following the disturbance than in the third year. The three species studied exhibited great tolerance to the short-term effects of the storm since we found no differences in density or reproductive parameters between the nine breeding seasons prior to the disturbance and the three which immediately followed it. We suggest that the tolerance shown by these three species to windstorms in semi-arid Mediterranean zones could be an adaptive response, resulting from the climatic and human pressures which have prevailed from the Bronze Age to the present day. © 2013 .","Booted Eagle; Breeding success; Common Buzzard; Nest loss; Nesting stand damage; Northern Goshawk; Windthrow disturbance","adaptation; anthropogenic effect; breeding season; Bronze Age; climate effect; community response; environmental disturbance; extreme event; Mediterranean environment; niche; raptor; reproductive success; semiarid region; storm; tolerance; windthrow; Spain","Martínez, J.E.; Departamento de Ecología e Hidrología, Universidad de Murcia, Campus de Espinardo, 30100 Murcia, Spain; email: ecoljemt@um.es",,,1146609X,,ACOEE,,"English","Acta Oecol.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874566163

Strategies to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) are being pursued in numerous developing countries. Proponents contest that REDD mechanisms could deliver sustainable development by contributing to both environmental protection and economic development, particularly in poor forest communities. However, among the challenges to REDD and natural resource management more generally is the need to develop a comprehensive understanding of cross-sectoral linkages and address how they impact the pursuit of sustainable development. Drawing on an exploratory case study of Ghana, this paper aims to outline the linkages between the forestry and minerals sectors. It argues that contemporary debates give incommensurate attention to the reclamation of large-scale mine sites located in forest reserves and neglect to consider more nuanced links, which characterise the forestry-mining nexus in Ghana. A review of key stakeholders further elucidates the complex networks that characterise these linkages and highlights the important role of traditional authorities in governing across sectors. If the multiple roles of local resource users and traditional authorities continue to be neglected in policy mechanisms, schemes such as REDD will continue to fall short of achieving sustainable development.","cross-sectoral governance; forest; mining; REDD; sustainable development","deforestation; developing world; economic development; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental protection; forest management; forest resource; governance approach; mining; mining industry; strategic approach; sustainable development; Ghana","Hirons, M.; School of Agriculture, Policy and Development, University of ReadingUnited Kingdom; email: m.a.hirons@pgr.reading.ac.uk",,,14746743,,,,"English","Int.

Large-scale SCM practices are at the center of an environmental and legal controversy that has spawned lawsuits and major environmental investigations. SCM techniques extract multiple coal seams by removing an area of many square kilometers and creating serious environmental problems. Information about mining activities location is essential for environmental applications, specifically the temporal and spatial patterns of land cover/land use change (LCLUC). Advancements in satellite imagery analysis provide possibilities to investigate new approaches for LCLUC detection caused by SCM globally. However there is no study that analyzes the changes produced for SCM at a global scale. Our work examines three areas of coal extraction in the world: Spain, United States of America (USA), and Australia. We used Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to map SCM affected area. Endmember spectra of vegetation, soil, and impervious surfaces were collected from the Landsat TM image with the help of a fine resolution orthophotographs and the pixel purity index (PPI). Reference endmembers from an Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) spectral library were utilized as well. An unsupervised classifier was applied to the fraction images to obtain an estimation of active SCM affected area. Classification accuracy was reported using error matrixes and κ statistic using active SCM affected area perimeters digitized from fine resolution orthophotographs as reference data. In addition, we compared the accuracy of the MESMA based estimation to estimates using Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), and a spectral index traditionally used as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) testing statistical significance using a Z-test of their κ statistics. Results showed a significant improvement in the accuracy of the SCM affected area using MESMA with an average increase of the κ statistic of 31%. We conclude that MESMA-based approach is effective in mapping SCM active affected area. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Landsat; MESMA; SMA; Surface coal mining","Affected area; Airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer; Australia; Classification accuracy; Coal extraction; Coal seams; Endmembers; Environmental applications; Environmental investigation; Environmental problems; Error matrix; Fine resolution; Forest ecosystem; Fraction images; Global scale; Impervious surface; Land-cover/land-use change; LANDSAT; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Landsat TM images; MESMA; Mining activities; Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis; Normalized difference vegetation index; Orthophotographs; Pixel purity index; Reference data; Reference endmembers; SMA; Spectral indices; Spectral libraries; Spectral mixture analysis; Statistical significance; Surface coal mining; Temporal and spatial pattern; United States of America; Coal deposits; Coal mines; Estimation; Satellite imagery; Environmental regulations; accuracy assessment; AVIRIS; coal mining; digitization; environmental issue; environmental planning; forest ecosystem; land classification; land cover; land use change; Landsat; Landsat thematic mapper; mapping method; NDVI; satellite imagery; spectral analysis; Australia; Spain; United States","Quintano, C.; Electronic Technology Department, University of Valladolid, Industrial Engineering School (EII), C/ Francisco Mendizábal, s/n, 47014-Valladolid, Spain; email: menchu@tele.uva.es",,,00344257,,RSEEA,,"English","Remote Sens.

This study was undertaken, in Chingola District in Zambia, operation centre for Konkola Copper Mines (KCM), and Lubumbashi in DRC, where Gécamines and other mining companies operate, to ascertain the relationship between copper mining, forest management and forest-based livelihoods. A multi-site approach was utilized for consultations with diverse actors at local, district and national levels, and with forest dependent communities from fringes of towns and in remote areas where mines have been obtaining timber. Interviews and field observations revealed that mining affects forests in a number of direct and indirect ways; from deforestation during green site development and sourcing of high quality timber to the sharp but indirect pressures over forests through the population pull effect of mining towns. Impacts on forest communities were in large part negative and huge investment in mining were in sharp contrast with levels of poverty and environmental degradation.

Approximately 14% of the trees showed some damage from the ice storm with Ostrya virginiana, Acer rubrum, and Quercus rubra being the most susceptible to damage.

To fill these gaps our study examines the washoff and leaching dynamics of Na +, Mg 2+, K +, Ca 2+, Cl -, SO 4 2-, and NO 3 - throughfall derived from bulk and sequentially sampled rain events across leafed, leafless and both transitional phenoseasons over a 3-year period (2008-2010). As throughfall washoff and leached solute fluxes are also closely-coupled to rainfall conditions, we further examine the effects of storm characteristics on phenoseasonal washoff-dominated (Na + and Cl -) and leaching-dominated (K +, Ca 2+, Mg 2+) fluxes through intrastorm event comparison plots and factorial MANOVA. Highly significant differences in leached and washoff solute fluxes were found across meteorological conditions (p&lt;0.001) nested within phenoseasonal divisions (p&lt;0.00001). Phenoseasonal washoff Na + and Cl - fluxes seemed to be more closely related to leaf area; whereas, leaching flux and canopy exchange of all solutes to correspond more with major phenological changes (when the canopies tend to be most metabolically active). The greatest differences in leached Mg 2+, K +, Ca 2+, and SO 4 2- fluxes were not between the full leafed and leafless phenoseasons (33-80% difference), but between the transitional periods (80 to 200 fold greater during leaf senescence than leaf emergence). Intrastorm average canopy NO 3 - leaching, however, ranged from low losses (1μmol cm -2h -1) to canopy uptake (-2μmol cm -2h -1) during both transitional phenoseasons. K +, Ca 2+, Mg 2+ were all markedly more exchangeable during senescence, with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ being more tightly held by the canopy. Leaching rates and fluxes for all measured solutes were negligible to negative during emergence, except for K + and SO 4 2-. Our results indicate that much of the variance in timing and magnitude of throughfall solute fluxes to forest soils within temperate deciduous ecosystems may be ascribed to phenologically-delineated seasons and storm conditions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Canopy leaching; Deciduous canopy; Dry deposition washoff; Intraevent sampling; Season; Throughfall","Canopy leaching; Deciduous canopy; Dry deposition; Season; Throughfall; Calcium; Ecosystems; Ion exchange; Leaching; Phenols; Rain; Sodium; Soils; Storms; Forestry; calcium ion; chloride ion; magnesium ion; nitrate; potassium ion; rain; sodium ion; sulfate; biogeochemical cycle; canopy exchange; deciduous forest; ecosystem dynamics; forest canopy; forest ecosystem; leaching; phenology; seasonal variation; solute transport; storm; temperate forest; article; biogeochemical cycling; canopy; dynamics; ecosystem; environmental aspects and related phenomena; leaching; leaf emergence; leaf senescence; meteorological phenomena; phenology; phenoseason; plant parameters; priority journal; solute; storm; temperate deciduous forest; washoff dynamics; Air Pollutants; Analysis of Variance; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Ions; Maryland; Plant Leaves; Rain; Seasons; Soil; Trees; Climates; Deposition; Ecosystems; Forest Canopy; Hardwoods; Ion Exchange; Leaching; Phenol; Rain; Sampling; Sodium; Soil","Van Stan, J.T.; Department of Geology and Geography, Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, 30640, United States; email: jvanstan@georgiasouthern.edu",,,00489697,,STEVA,"22621811","English","Sci.

In both areas it was observed that the uprooted trees presented an average height and diameter bigger than the trees that remained intact.

Future climate change is expected to further intensify disturbance regimes, which makes addressing disturbances in ecosystem management a top priority. As a prerequisite a broader understanding of disturbance impacts and ecosystem responses is needed. With regard to the effects of strong winds - the most detrimental disturbance agent in Europe - monitoring and management has focused on structural damage, i.e., tree mortality from uprooting and stem breakage. Effects on the functioning of trees surviving the storm (e.g., their productivity and allocation) have been rarely accounted for to date. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that growth reduction was significant and pervasive in a 6.79·million hectare forest landscape in southern Sweden following the storm Gudrun (January 2005). Wind-related growth reduction in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests surviving the storm exceeded 10% in the worst hit regions, and was closely related to maximum gust wind speed (R 2 = 0.849) and structural wind damage (R 2 = 0.782). At the landscape scale, wind-related growth reduction amounted to 3.0 million m 3 in the three years following Gudrun. It thus exceeds secondary damage from bark beetles after Gudrun as well as the long-term average storm damage from uprooting and stem breakage in Sweden. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that the impact of strong winds on forest ecosystems is not limited to the immediately visible area of structural damage, and call for a broader consideration of disturbance effects on ecosystem structure and functioning in the context of forest management and climate change mitigation. © 2012 Seidl, Blennow.",,"article; climate change; controlled study; deforestation; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; forest management; growth inhibition; landscape; landscape ecology; nonhuman; Norway spruce; Sweden; tree growth; wind; disaster; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; hurricane; spruce; tree; Hexapoda; Picea abies; Scolytinae; Climate Change; Cyclonic Storms; Disasters; Ecosystem; Picea; Sweden; Trees; Wind","Blennow, K.; Faculty of Landscape Planning, Horticulture and Agricultural Science, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Alnarp, Sweden; email: kristina.blennow@slu.se",,,19326203,,,"22413012","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857854219

Because many forests are intensively used our knowledge on forest dynamics after such disturbances is limited. In the Bavarian Forest National Park/Germany after the wind throw event in summer 1983, we started our long-term observation in nearly natural Norway spruce forests within 5-year intervals up to 2010. A part of the affected stands was cleared, while another part was left untouched for natural development. Here, we focused on the tree species regeneration, using an individual-based approach. We expected that tree species regeneration in both management types would follow different succession pathways. Indeed, we found different regeneration characteristics, depending on whether the area had been cleared or left unmanaged. For example, for the target species Norway spruce, a chronic regeneration during the first two decades with low numbers, but a high survival rate of individuals, and for the pioneer species birch, pulse regeneration with high numbers of individuals only at the beginning and high individual loss during the following years occurred. Unmanaged and cleared wind throw areas, respectively, offer different quantities of micro-sites: the pit and mound structure as mineral soil disturbance was limited to less than 1/4 in the untouched area, whereas there was mineral soil disturbance more or less everywhere on the cleared parts. Type and intensity of disturbance allow a wide range of succession pathways after wind throw, based on the fundamental processes of germination and competition. Therefore, for protection area management as well as for forest management, the human activity immediately after the event is crucial. Because each management impact will change the succession pathway fundamentally any impact has to be omitted in protection areas with the main goal of natural vegetation succession. Also in managed forests abdication of any impact on small areas may improve the natural structures and biodiversity of forests. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Forest dynamics; Norway spruce forests; Permanent plot; Succession pathways; Transect; Wind throw","biodiversity; competition (ecology); deciduous tree; disturbance; environmental disturbance; forest dynamics; forest ecosystem; forest management; germination; human activity; succession; survival; transect; windthrow; Norway; Picea abies","Fischer, A.; Geobotany, Department of Ecology and Ecosystem Management, Technische Universität München, Hans-Carl-von-Carlowitz-Platz 2, 85354 Freising, Germany; email: a.fischer@wzw.tum.de",,,16124669,,,,"English","Eur.

Using data from long-term growth and yield experiments in Baden-Wuerttemberg (south-western Germany), which permit separation of storm damage from other causes of mortality for individual trees, we investigated the influence of soil, site, forest stand, and tree parameters on storm damage, especially focusing on the influence of silvicultural interventions. For this purpose, a four-step modeling approach was applied in order to extract the main risk factors for (1) the general stand-level occurrence of storm damage, (2) the occurrence of total stand damage, and (3) partial storm damage within stands. The estimated stand-level probability of storm damage obtained in step 3 was then offset in order to describe the damage potential for the individual trees within each partially damaged stand (4). Generalized linear mixed models were applied. Our results indicate that tree species and stand height are the most important storm risk factors, also for characterizing the long-term storm risk. Additionally, data on past timber removals and selective thinnings appear more important for explaining storm damage predisposition than for example stand density, soil and site conditions or topographic variables. When quantified with a weighting method (summarizing the relative weight of single predictors or groups of predictors), removals could explain up to 20% of storm risk. The stepwise modeling approach proved an important methodological feature of the analysis, since it enabled consideration of the large number of observations without damage (""zero inflation"") in a statistically correct way. These results form a reliable basis for quantifying forest management's direct impact on the risk of storm damage. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Empirical modeling; Generalized linear mixed models; Long-term storm damage; Silviculture; Thinning; Windthrow","climate effect; empirical analysis; environmental disturbance; forest; growth response; mortality; numerical model; risk assessment; silviculture; storm damage; thinning; tree; yield response; Baden-Wurttemberg; Germany","Albrecht, A.; Forest Research Institute Baden-Württemberg, Wonnhaldestr. 4, 79100 Freiburg, Germany; email: axel.albrecht@forst.bwl.de",,,16124669,,,,"English","Eur.

Artisanal miners in Cameroon and the Central African Republic (CAR) commonly make sacrifices to their god of diamonds, to improve fortunes. This study looks into 'the other forces'; institutions that play a role in shaping the sector and its outcomes. These institutions comprise formal and informal institutions at a local, national, regional and international level. Although artisanal miners in TNS benefit by gaining cash income, this activity also carries risks as income is highly disparate and environmental impacts in this priority forest conservation area are expected to increase due to the growing competition over land use. It was concluded from a literature review, interviews and site visits that informal arrangements dominate the sector, especially in Cameroon, leading to poor relations between officials and miners and meaning that miners have few rights and no voice. The current institutional setup is inadequate to deal with current and anticipated social and environmental issues. Future interventions need to take into account the existing (local) types of organization, vulnerable groups, the interests of multiple actors and the fact that most miners are experienced but combine mining with other activities, such as agriculture, fishing and harvesting forest products. African initiatives concerning ASM offer opportunities to Cameroon and CAR to collaborate with other countries to combat similar issues. A regional integrated approach of both the forest and mining sector would be especially relevant for trans-boundary agreements, such as concerning the TNS, to reinforce positive outcomes for the landscape and the area's population. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Artisanal mining; Cameroon; Central African Republic; Diamond; Gold; Institution","Artisanal miners; Artisanal mining; Cameroon; Cash income; Central African Republic; Congo basins; Environmental issues; Forest conservation; Forest landscape; Forest products; Institution; Institutional framework; Integrated approach; Literature reviews; Mining sector; Site visits; Trans-boundary; Conservation; Environmental impact; Forestry; Gold; Miners; Societies and institutions; Diamonds; artisanal mining; diamond; environmental impact; environmental issue; forest management; gold; institutional framework; landscape; nature conservation; Cameroon; Central African Republic; Congo; Conservation; Diamond; E I S; Forest Products; Forestry; Gold; Mining; Cameroon; Congo Basin","Schure, J.; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), Central Africa Regional Office, P.O.

Although disturbance of this scale occurred rarely (once in a century), it provided a unique opportunity to study short-and long-term impacts on the compositions, structure and succession of forest ecosystem. A 3. 2 hm 2 plot was set up in the ice storm-damaged montane evergreen broad-leaved forest in Damingshan National Nature Reserve. The plot was divided into 80 subplots, each of 400m 2. Within each subplot, all trees (diameter at breast height or DBH≥1. 0cm) were identified, mapped and tagged at breast height (1. 3 m from the base) with pre-numbered aluminum tags, and the DBH and stem heights of these taged trees was measured. In addition, the LAI of the plots were determined. We assigned each ice-damaged tree one of the following three damage categories: main stem broken, tree uprooted, or dead. We carried out surveys in 2009 and 2010. The evergreen broad-leaved forest of Damingshan National Nature Reserve were affected severely by the ice storm as the damaged trees accounted for 51. 8% of the total individuals with DBH ≥1 0cm in 2009. There were 776 dead trees in 2010, 6. 75 times of that in 2009. In particular, small trees (DBH 2-6cm) were more damaged more severely than big ones, accounting for 68. 18%, 54. 29%, and 83. 51% of the total broken main stems, the total uprooted and the total dead trees, respectively. Resilience of canopy cover to the disturbance was great, as indicated by 55. 4% increase in LAI of the forest from 2009 to2010. Furthermore, species abundance, richness, Shannon- Wiener index and Simpson index of the community had increased 14. 96%,10. 05%,3. 89% and 1. 13%, respectively, from 2009 to 2010. These changes were statistically significantly (P =0. 018-0. 000, df =79). However, the mortality of large trees of dominant canopy species (Huodendron biaristatum, and Acer fabric) will affect the community stability.","Damingshan national nature reserve; Evergreen broadleaved forest; Forest canopy structure; Ice storm damaged; Species diversity; Subtropics","abundance; canopy; community dynamics; disturbance; environmental restoration; evergreen forest; forest canopy; ice storm; leaf area index; mortality; reforestation; species diversity; species richness; subtropical region; succession; vegetation cover; China; Daming Mountain Nature Reserve; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Acer; Huodendron biaristatum","Wen, Y.; State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, Nanning 530004, China; email: wenyg@263.net",,,10000933,,,,"English","Shengtai Xuebao Acta Ecol.

However, the role of natural disturbances in shaping European mountain forest ecosystems has not been adequately studied, possibly because of the perception that the development of most European forests is primarily shaped by human influences and/or fine-scale gap-phase dynamics.In the present study, we investigate the long-term disturbance history of old protected forest dominated by Norway spruce in the Parangalitsa Reserve, Bulgaria. We used aerial photo interpretation and dendroecological methods to reconstruct the history of wind, insect, and fire disturbances across a topographically complex landscape. Over the past 150. years wind has been the most important disturbance agent in this ecosystem and at least 18% of the forested area shows evidence of high-severity blowdowns. Windthrow patches ranged in size from <1. ha to >10. ha (minimum 0.11. ha, mean 0.16. ha, maximum 10. ha). Although small disturbances were much more frequent, few larger blowdowns accounted for most of the disturbed area. Pure coniferous and single-cohort coniferous forest patches were more affected by blowdowns than mixed coniferous-deciduous and multi-cohort coniferous forest patches. Although bark beetle (Ips typhographus) populations were large enough to cause mortality of some live trees, the populations did not grow to epidemic proportions during recent decades. Fire disturbance was of limited importance in the last 200. years and only two patches (4% of the study area) showed evidence of fire.The present research indicates that wind disturbances have been characteristic of these ecosystems at least over the past decades to centuries. Thus, blowdowns appear integral to the normal function and structure of the Picea-dominated mountain forests in the region and such events, in and of themselves, do not represent unhealthy forest conditions or environmental emergencies. Management strategies that aim to maintain these ecosystems within a natural range of variation should incorporate wind disturbances into the management strategy. The frequency and magnitude of future wind disturbances may be considered within the historical framework described in the current study to assess potential effects of climate change on altered disturbance regimes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bulgaria; Dendroecology; Disturbance; Forest dynamics; Picea; Windthrow","Bulgaria; Dendroecology; Disturbance; Forest dynamics; Picea; Windthrow; Climate change; Forestry; Landforms; Ecosystems; aerial photography; assessment method; beetle; climate change; coniferous forest; dendrochronology; disturbance; dominance; epidemic; forest ecosystem; frequency analysis; gap dynamics; landscape; magnitude; management practice; montane forest; perception; population structure; protected area; reconstruction; topography; wind; Ecology; Forest Management; Forests; Insects; Picea; Picea Abies; Seasonal Variation; Wind; Bulgaria; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Ips; Picea; Picea abies; Scolytinae","Panayotov, M.; University of Forestry, Dendrology Department, Kliment Ohridski 10 Blvd., Sofia 1756, Bulgaria; email: mp2@abv.bg",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

By site specific survey, coupled with review of the government documents and reports, we made an impact assessment of the ice storm on China's forests at regional and local scale. The ice storm affected one-tenth of the forests in 19 provinces, with masson pine, Chinese fir and bamboo plantation among the most extensively slashed. The damage degree for the subtropical typical forest types ranged from 25% to 66%. Ice-damage to tree/bamboo exhibited different patterns, with uprooting and bending being the most common. The topographical variables (altitude, slope aspect), stand density, tree size and age, and management practice were all found to have effects on damage severity. High altitude and north-faced slope aggravated ice damage; native pine exhibited better resistance to damage than exotic. The effect of stand age and tree size on damage seemed to vary with species. The ice storm taught us valuable lessons. Native species should be put at the most priority in large scale forestation. Good management practice may help to reduce the risk of extreme climatic events.

One site was a young, even-aged, monoculture, deciduous forest; the other was an uneven-aged mixed forest of evergreen and deciduous overstory tree species, including some over 200 years old. On 8 September 2004, a strong typhoon struck the forests, after which leaf and branch amounts decreased in young growth forest, but foliage showed little change in old growth forest. By 2006, foliage at the young-growth forest had recovered to the 2004 pretyphoon state. Average daily accumulated gross primary production (GPPd), terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TERd), and net ecosystem exchange (NEEd) were assessed for six growth stages annually. After the typhoon, large increases in GPP d were found during the growing stage of overstory tree species with high photosynthetic rates compared to that before the typhoon. Pronounced increases in GPPd and corresponding large reductions in NEE d were detected at the young-growth forest, indicating that NEE d was largely regulated by GPPd throughout the growing stages. Although EC measurements contain uncertainty, our continuous EC measurements revealed that interannual variability in meteorological variables and structural changes in foliage have only small impacts on GPP and NEE, while photosynthetic recovery of foliage from typhoon damage has high potential to increase GPP and enhance NEE as compared with those under nondamage conditions.

Bats are the only forest-dwelling mammals capable of true flight. At a local scale, bat flight ability, which may be related to ecomorphological traits, is an important factor influencing spatial distribution. We tested two postulates: (1) the spatial distribution of bats is affected by sizes of forest gaps created by natural disturbances and (2) species-specific responses can be predicted from bat ecomorphological traits (aspect ratio (AR) and wingtip shape index (WT)) that influence bat flight ability. We found that sizes of forest gaps affected the occurrence of each bat species and species richness of bats at local scales; species-specific responses were related to the ecomorphological traits of individual species. Bat species with high AR and low WT were not affected by variation in canopy gap size. In contrast, bat species with low AR and high WT responded negatively to gap size, and those with intermediate AR and WT responded positively to canopy gap size at sites with small-sized gaps but responded negatively to large-sized gaps. Overall bat species richness responded negatively to gap size. Thus, ecomorphological traits may be important determinants of bat spatial distributions and species diversity at local scales in disturbed habitats. In this study, forest edges might have been undersampled due to the location of bat detectors. However, this potential undersampling should not have affected the interpretation of occurrence patterns of bat species responding to gap size. Our results imply that bat conservation efforts in forest lands should take into consideration specific responses related to ecomorphological traits of species inhabiting an area. The results also suggest that quantifying the effects of natural disturbances on bat assemblages may provide a knowledge base for forest management to minimize the impacts of unavoidable anthropogenic disturbances on bat species diversity.

Box 249118, Coral Gables, FL 33124, United States","Chusquea ramosissima is a native monocarpic bamboo species growing in subtropical forests of northeastern Argentina, which can dominate gaps and open forests in the region, particularly after human disturbance. This bamboo species started to flower in different areas of northeastern Argentina in 2001, with the flowering peak during 2002 and 2003 and small isolated flowering events still occurring until 2010. We studied the effects of C. ramosissima flowering and die-back on microclimate, litter decomposition, nutrient availability, sapling growth, abundance and regeneration of tree canopy species. We wanted to know how environmental conditions and ecosystem processes change through time after bamboo flowering and if bamboo die-back would favor regeneration of canopy trees. Twenty 50 × 50. m plots of flowering and non-flowering bamboo were permanently marked and vegetation dynamics as well as nutrient cycling and microclimate studies were performed. C. ramosissima die-back enhanced growth and reduced mortality rate of tree saplings during the first year after flowering. Only growth of tree saplings previously established was enhanced by the flowering event and tree-species richness and saplings abundance of canopy trees did not change as expected due to bamboo flowering. The short-term effect of tree saplings growth was likely due to incident solar radiation at the forest floor which doubled in the first year after the bamboo flowering event. Increased light availability at the forest floor simultaneously promoted the growth of other understory plants such as ferns, lianas and Piper spp. that rapidly colonized gaps and intercepted a percentage of the incident solar radiation after the first year, which together with an increased litter layer due to the senescence of the bamboo, may have inhibited establishment of new tree individuals and affected tree growth. Contrary to predictions, soil water, litter decomposition and soil nutrients were not significantly affected by bamboo flowering. Thus, successful tree regeneration in gaps following bamboo flowering appears to be restricted to a very narrow window of increased light availability (i.e., 1. year) before growth of other understory plants and rapid re-colonization of bamboo. Changes in resource availability, and the opportunity for overstory regeneration after bamboo flowering events appears to depend on climatic and community characteristics of the ecosystem where the flowering event occurs and also, on the flowering patterns and their synchronicity. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bamboo flowering; Chusquea ramosissima; Environmental changes; Regeneration; Semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest; Soil nutrient dynamics","Bamboo; Ecosystems; Floors; Incident solar radiation; Nutrients; Soil moisture; Technology transfer; Atlantic forest; Chusquea ramosissima; Environmental change; Regeneration; Soil nutrients; Reforestation; abundance; bamboo; dieback; flowering; forest floor; habitat fragmentation; habitat management; human activity; light availability; mortality; nutrient cycling; recruitment (population dynamics); regeneration; resource availability; sapling; senescence; soil nutrient; soil water; solar radiation; species richness; understory; Argentina; Misiones [Argentina]; Chusquea ramosissima; Filicophyta; Piperaceae","Montti, L.; Instituto de Biología Subtropical, Andresito 21, CP 3370 Puerto Iguazú, Misiones, Argentina; email: liamontti@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

The fast or early detection of forest fires [2] is a essential element for controlling such phenomenon. The application of remote sensing is at present a significant method for forest fires monitoring [3], particularly in vast and remote areas. This paper presents an intelligent system to detect the presence of forest fires in the forest spatial data using SMO and Artificial Neural Networks. Extensive experimental assessments on publicly available spatial data illustrated the efficiency of the proposed system in effectively detecting forest fires.

Trees need adequate quantities of water, heat, light, nutrients, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and other abiotic resources to sustain life, growth, and reproduction. When these factors are deficient or excessive, they cause mortality. According to the concept of baseline mortality (Chapters 1, 2, and 3), a certain number of trees must die as a forest ages to maintain a healthy condition. Abiotic factors kill trees in different ways, e.g., starvation, desiccation, uprooting, or stem breakage. The patterns of mortality and how the forest responds determine how changing stand structures impact sustainability and productivity. Here, we discuss abiotic factors, and how they influence diameter and age class distributions. We conclude this chapter by suggesting general principles about the impacts of abiotic disturbances on stand structures within forest ecosystems. Weather events Weather is the set of all phenomena occurring in a given atmosphere at a given time. Weather phenomena include wind, clouds, rain, snow, fog, dust storms, ice storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and others. Some weather events can reset forest succession directly by killing trees. Weather events also can influence the rate and direction of forest succession indirectly by increasing fuels to enhance fire risk or by predisposing trees to other stresses. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511974977; 9780521766692,,,"English","Forest Health: An Integr.

To this end maximizing wind penetration is the most critical factor for achieving the above mandatory target. Relevant studies have showed that an installed capacity between 9,000 MW and 12,000 MW of wind power plants should be achieved nationwide, which is several scales up compared to the current total of about 1,000 MW. Considering the Greek electrical grid, most of these plants have to be installed in areas of high wind potential. Thus, the possibility of constructing wind farms in forested areas increases and consequently some clearing of trees might be required. Looking into cases not characterized by the biodiversity or other sensitive environmental parameters, the environmental benefit is evaluated in terms of CO2 balancing. A detailed cost-benefit analysis of the latter is performed in the current paper, including: • CO2absorption considering the density and the type of trees being cleared • CO2 emissions from fossil fuel necessary for manufacturing and construction • Lifetime CO2 emissions reduction due to wind farm operation, parameterized by capacity factor Actual data analysis leads to the conclusion that long term reduction of CO2 gained by the operation of wind farms outweighs by far the clearing of trees and the temporary rise of CO2 emissions during the construction period of the project. The environmental impact on the atmosphere is negligible when compared to the effects of conventional energy sources. Finally, the estimation of CO2 balancing and the corresponding environmental benefits reinforce the social acceptance in cases of constructing wind farms at forested areas.",,"Capacity factors; Construction period; Consumption of energy; Conventional energy sources; Critical factors; Electrical grids; Emissions reduction; Environmental benefits; Environmental parameter; Forested area; High winds; Installed capacity; Parameterized; Social acceptance; Wind farm; Wind penetration; Biodiversity; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Emission control; Environmental impact; Exhibitions; Factor analysis; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Wind power; Carbon dioxide; Analysis Of Variance; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Electric Power Transmission; Electric Utilities; Emission; Exhibitions; Fossil Fuels; Greece; Networks","Apostolaki-Iosifidou, E.A.; InFlow - Wind Energy ConsultingGreece",,,,9781617823107,,,"English","Eur.

The extensive literature on the “resource curse” phenomenon at the national level generally finds that economic dependence on mineral resources is associated with lower levels of economic growth. This paper shows that further insight can be obtained by studying microlevel resource curse because of heterogeneity in institutions, natural resources and economic behaviors. Design/methodology/approach – The paper empirically tests the resource curse hypothesis with data from a stratified random sample of 600 households in 20 villages in the mining district of Keonjhar, Orissa. Household surveys were used to collect data on demography, forest dependence, health and household economics. Using geographical information system (GIS), the household data were integrated with secondary spatial data on land cover and location of mines to construct multiple measures of exposure to iron ore mines. Findings – Microeconometric models demonstrate the multifaceted nature of the relationships between mine exposure, forest resources and human welfare. Households closer to mines experience higher incidences of many illnesses, rank lower on indicators of human development and own fewer production assets. They also derive fewer forest benefits because forests are more degraded and less accessible in villages closer to mines. Originality/value – This analysis remains timely because of ongoing violent conflicts and concern over negative impacts on the welfare of rural populations in the mining areas of India, which is consistent with the notion of a resource curse. The paper's findings on the magnitude of negative impacts can inform the policy discourse (e.g. benefits sharing schemes) related to miningled growth. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Econometrics; Forests; India; Mining industry; Natural resources; Social welfare economics",,,,,17538254,,,,"English","Indian Growth Dev.

Stand-level models have been then developed for the most affected two species, Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus uncinata Ram., to describe damage severity. The models were based on data from national forest inventory plots. They included variables related to the spatial location and structure of the stands, being validated using a sub-set of the database (25% of the plots randomly selected). Mountain pine forests (Pinus uncinata Ram.) were the most heavily affected by wind and snow disturbances. For both mountain and Scots pine species, topographic exposure and the severity of the local storm regime had an important effect on the degree of damage. Stand's resistance to wind and snow was found to be dependent on the combined effect of basal area and mean slenderness of the dominant trees. For a given slenderness ratio, damage increased strongly in lower-density stands, particularly in stands with basal areas below 15 m2/ha. Stand structure was particularly important to define the resistance of Scots pine stands, which presented a higher vulnerability to wind and snow under higher degree of even-agedness. The models presented in this study provide empirically-based information that can be used to implement silvicultural practices to minimize the risk of those forests to suffer wind and snow-related damages.","Conifers; Models; Pyrenees; Snow damages; Stability; Stand structure; Wind damages","Basal area; Combined effect; Conifers; Degree of damages; Higher-degree; Induced damage; Level model; National forest inventories; Pine forest; Pinus nigra; Pinus sylvestris; Pyrenees; Scots pine; Scots pine stands; Silvicultural practices; Slenderness ratios; Spatial location; Stand levels; Stand structures; Wind damages; Landforms; Snow; Forestry; basal area; coniferous forest; damage; database; environmental disturbance; forest inventory; forestry modeling; risk assessment; silviculture; snow; spatial analysis; stand structure; vulnerability; wind velocity; Forestry; Pinus Nigra; Pinus Sylvestris; Pinus Uncinata; Snow; Softwoods; Stability; Wind; Pyrenees; Coniferophyta; Pinus mugo; Pinus nigra; Pinus sylvestris; Pinus uncinata","Martín-alcón, S.; Forest Technology Center of Catalonia, Solsona, Lleida, Spain; email: santiago.martin@ctfc.es",,,00375330,,SIFEA,,"English","Silva Fenn.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956966738

The combination of environmental variables defined at broad and local scales is necessary to provide regeneration distribution models with a small resolution (tree scale) that are valid on a large spatial scale (regional scale). Our aim was to quantify how gap partitioning among tree species at the seedling stage varies across large soil and stand type gradients. Regeneration inventories performed 5 years after gap creation were used to analyse the combined effects of soil type, stand type, and position within canopy gaps on the regeneration development of eight western European broadleaved species: Acer campestre, Acer pseudoplatanus, Betula pendula, Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus sp., and Salix caprea. A clear pattern of gap partitioning among the eight species was observed. All species had higher density at the gap edge except birch and willow showing the highest presence in gap centres. For all species, the probability of presence of tall seedlings (height > 0.5 m) increased from gap edge to gap centre. Small seedlings presented the opposite trend except birch and willow. Soil pH influenced probability of presence for each species, but did not affect the pattern of gap partitioning among species.

We compared the understory that spontaneously developed in seven types of forest stands: one type was unreclaimed stands (spontaneously overgrown by Betula pendula and Salix caprea) and six were plantations, each dominated by one tree genus (Alnus, Larix, Picea, Pinus, Quercus, and Tilia). The age of the stands ranged from 22 to 33 years. The cover of understory plant species in each stand was estimated, and 16 other environmental and community variables were quantified. The number of plant species was highest in Quercus, Larix, and unreclaimed stands, and was negatively correlated with forest canopy cover and with the cover of the understory dominant, the grass Calamagrostis epigejos. Understory composition differed considerably among the types of forest stands and was significantly explained by the measured environmental variables. Forward selection in redundancy analysis indicated that the most important variable driving understory composition was thickness of the fermentation layer, which is clearly connected with soil development. Environmental variables, including fermentation layer, were also affected by the type of forest stand. Therefore, all of the explained variability in understory composition could be attributed to the type of forest stand, which apparently affected the understory by its impact on soil formation. However, the most favorable soil conditions were not favorable for understory development, as they supported mainly C. epigejos, which suppressed other species. Our study also showed that even in the absence of reclamation measures, mining sites can be successfully restored due to spontaneous succession. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of the wind disaster on the forest tree species composition and diversity were different. In BKPF, the total number of trees increased significantly, but the tree species number and α diversity index had no significant change; in SFF, only the Shannon diversity index and Simpson dominance index decreased significantly; while in EBF, all diversity indices except Pielou evenness index had significant decrease. The responses of dominance tree composition and regeneration to the wind disaster depended on forest types. Comparing with the plots not suffered from wind disaster, the BKPF under wind disaster disturbance had greatly different dominance tree compositions, but the difference in both SFF and EBF was not significant. The BKPF' s sapling regeneration was fairly good, while the SFF' s was small, and EBF almost had no sapling regeneration. All the results suggested that the effects of wind disaster disturbance on the test forest ecosystems in study areas was not removed even after 23 years, and the recovery of forest after wind disaster disturbance needs a relatively long time.","Broad-leaved Korean pine forest; Diversity index; Erman' s birch forest; Recovery state; Spruce-fir forest; Wind disturbance","broad-leaved forest; coniferous forest; disaster; diversity index; dominance; field survey; forest ecosystem; regeneration; species evenness; wind stress; article; birch; China; disaster; ecosystem; energy conservation; environmental monitoring; growth, development and aging; pine; spruce; time; tree; wind; Betula; China; Conservation of Energy Resources; Disasters; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Picea; Pinus; Time Factors; Trees; Wind; Changbai Mountains; China; Abies; Picea; Pinus koraiensis","Guo, L.-P.; Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110016, China; email: guolipingiae@126.com",,,10019332,,,"20873609","Chinese","Chin.

In 1998, a severe ice storm damaged over ten million hectares of forest across northern New York State, eastern Canada, and New England impacting ecosystem processes across the landscape. This study investigated the spatial arrangement of forest damage at the terrestrial-aquatic interface, an ecological edge of importance to aquatic habitat and nutrient cycling. Vegetation indices, derived from satellite imagery and field-based data, were used to measure forest canopy damage across a 2045 km2 region in northern New York State affected by the 1998 storm. We investigated the forest damage gradient in the riparian zone of 13 stream segments of varying size (92.5 km total length) and 13 lakes (37.4 km of shoreline). Large streams (-fourth and fifth order), occurring in forests that received modest ice damage (&lt;15% disturbance coverage), exhibited significantly more damage in the riparian zone within 25 m of the water than in adjacent forest sections; F(3,12) = 7.3 P = 0.005. In similar moderately damaged forests, lake shorelines were significantly more damaged than interior forests; F(3,9) = 6.4 P = 0.013. Analysis of transitions in damage intensity revealed that canopy disturbance followed a decreasing trend (up to 3.5 times less) with movement inland from the terrestrial-aquatic interface. The observed predisposition of forest to disturbance along this ecosystem interface emphasizes the role of the physical landscape in concentrating the movement of wood from the forest canopy to locations proximate to water bodies, thus reinforcing findings that ice storms are drivers of ecological processes that are spatially concentrated. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Adirondacks; Ecological disturbance; Forest; Ice storm; Lakes; Littoral zone; Remote sensing; Streams; Terrestrial-aquatic interface; Transition analysis","data set; ecological impact; environmental disturbance; forest canopy; forest ecosystem; ice storm; landscape ecology; landscape structure; littoral environment; movement; nutrient cycling; riparian zone; satellite imagery; storm damage; streamwater; vegetation index; Adirondack Mountains; Canada; New England; New York [United States]; United States","Millward, A.

Characterizing these patterns in forested ecosystems with remote sensing data has been a persistent challenge as variation in severity may be heterogeneous at fine spatial scales. Yet the degree and pattern of disturbance severity are an important influence on successional dynamics. This study explored how spectral and textural characteristics of high-spatial resolution IKONOS imagery reflected patterns of disturbance severity across a windstorm damaged, 121-km2 area of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) in northeastern Minnesota, USA. In this study, spectral and spatial features of high-spatial resolution (1-m panchromatic and 4-m multispectral) IKONOS satellite imagery from a single post-disturbance date are coupled with field observations of disturbance within 0.045-ha field plots to access the potential for empirically modeling disturbance severity across this heterogeneous landscape within the BWCAW. Combining textural and spectral features led to a multiple regression model that explained 68% of the variance, and predicted disturbance severity equally well for ground data not included in the model development. The results suggest the utility of combining spatial and spectral data for detecting differences in forest structure caused by ecological processes such as disturbance. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This was done by employing: (i) Monte Carlo simulation technique for generating landscapes with different age class distributions, proportions of open areas (gaps), and tree species composition; and (ii) a mechanistic wind damage model, HWIND, for predicting the critical wind speeds at downwind stand edges of open areas (gaps) for risk consideration. The level of risk of wind damage observed at the landscape level was significantly affected by the presence of gaps and old stands. Even a slight increase in the proportion of gap areas or older stands had a significant impact on the total length of edges at risk. As a comparison, variation in species composition (Scots pine and/or Norway spruce) had much smaller impact on the risk of damage. In conclusion, the effects of forest structure on the risk of wind damage should especially be considered by forest managers in day-to-day forest planning in order to reduce the risk of wind damage both at the stand and landscape level. © 2009 INRA EDP Sciences.","Critical wind speed; Forest edges; Mechanistic model; Monte Carlo simulation; Risk of wind damage","boreal forest; coniferous tree; environmental risk; forest edge; forest management; landscape ecology; Monte Carlo analysis; species diversity; stand structure; wind velocity; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris","Zeng, H.; University of Windsor, Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; email: zenghc@uwindsor.ca",,,12864560,,AFOSF,,"English","Ann.

The use of native forest species fully adapted to these types of terrain is another aspect of great importance, once the non-selection of these species, even if abundant in the surrounding areas, as it is in our case, implies great mortality of individuals during the planting and their low fixation during the process. The establishment of a monitoring program that contemplates the advancements obtained in the soil, the vegetation and the return of wild animals also collaborate in the evaluation of the success of the process. And, finally, the effective participation of the mining company, accepting and applying the techniques tested and indicated by research, even if, initially, the return time is longer than expected, also guarantees the success of the process. The mining company not only implemented a partnership with important universities in Brazil to obtain solutions for the environmental problems but also applied the developed techniques and the monitoring program. In the present work, we have attempted to summarize important aspects to evaluate the advancements in the rehabilitation plan for those areas, being here presented some results of the monitoring of areas under different levels of recovery, in accordance with the techniques adopted. Biological parameters of the soil were used to verify the efficiency of these different techniques in the recovery process. This work is part of the monitoring program of areas in rehabilitation by the mining company, implemented as of 1999 and in partnership with universities. The microbial activity was determined through the quantification of the carbon and nitrogen microbial biomass (BMC and BMN) and the activity of the dehydrogenase evaluated in the mining floor and tailing areas in different levels of soil preparation and planting of native species. The analysis of the parameters studied revealed that the preparation of the soil, following the three years proposed by the methodology, was important for the success in establishing the rehabilitation process.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models can provide spatial patterns of wind and turbulence, and help to develop optimal installation strategies. The canopy-planetary boundary-layer model SCADIS is used to investigate the effect of forest gap size (within the diameter range of 3 - 75 tree heights, h) on wind energy related variables. A wind turbine was assumed with following features: the hub height and rotor diameter of 3.5h and 3h, respectively; this provides the clearance between the rotor and ground of 2h which is similar to the value obtained by the rule of thumb. Spatial variations of wind energy production, the average wind speed shear and cumulative TKE inside the layer of 2h - 5h above the ground around the gaps were estimated from modelled data. The results show that the effect of the forest gaps with diameters smaller than 55h on wind energy captured by the assumed wind turbine and located in the centre of round low-roughness gap is practically insignificant. The high level of spatial variation of considered characteristics within the clear-cut indicates that a joint influence of wind turbine properties and turbine's location within the gap can result in both win and loss of the wind energy capture.

Intensive data, which measured more than 20,000 damaged trees (defined as trees that were killed or lost their major crown) in <500 ha of a natural mixed forest, were collected immediately after a severe typhoon in 1954. More than half of the damaged trees had been uprooted, and the negative size-dependency was found for the proportion of uprooting throughout species. Simple correlation analyses with respect to the averaged species-specific characteristics suggested that tree species with a high crown-depth/height tended to uproot (against to stem breakage) in a size-class with diameter at breast height 30-50 cm. Although the census data had yielded no information about non-damaged trees, the estimation of pre-disturbed stand (based on 63 1-ha plot data together with aerial photographs and GIS) revealed that the observed damage reached ca. 25% in terms of basal area. The proportion of damaged trees seemed to be doubled among species (15-42% in basal area).

To study the natural regeneration pattern of the forest, the growth dynamics and quantitative characteristics of regenerated P. thunbergii trees were investigated in three plots. The tree ages were determined by counting tree branches, and the growth dynamics, age structure, and spatial distribution of re-generated young trees were studied by the method of spatial series substituting for time series. Based on the life table of population and the theory of survival analysis, the life tables of regener-ated young P. thunbergii trees were established, and the survivorship curves were drawn with field data. The results showed that in the three plots, the height and basal diameter growth of re-generated young P. thunbergii trees had exponential, linear, and quadratic functional relations with age, and the age structure was of spindle, discrete, and pyramid types, respectively. Most of the regenerated young trees were distributed at 0. 3-1. 2 m from their nearest standing trees, and the individuals of the young trees decreased near to or far from the nearest standing trees. In plots I and M , the expected average life of regenerated young P. thunbergii trees had a decrea-sing trend with their increasing age, and the survival number of the population also decreased with increasing population age. The survivorship curves of regenerated young P. thunbergii trees in the two plots approximated to the type of Deevey Π , indicating that the young P. thunbergii populations in the plots were at stable development stage. The population structure of regenerated young P. thunbergii trees in plot Π was lesser integral, suggesting that the population was of de-clining type, being related to human disturbance, slope and other environmental factors.","Coastal windbreak forest; Growth dy-namics; Northern shandong peninsula; Pinus thunbergii; Quantitative characteristics","coastal zone; environmental effect; environmental factor; growth rate; life table; population decline; population dynamics; population structure; regeneration; spatial distribution; survival; tree; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Shandong; Shandong Peninsula; Pinus thunbergii","Han, G.-X.; Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research for Sustainable Development, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai 264003 , Shandong, China; email: gxhan@yic.ac.cn",,,10004890,,SZAZE,,"Chinese","Chinese J.

In this study, the microclimatic effect of a windbreak forest surrounding a residence was analyzed based on field measurements and numerical simulation results. Spherical thermographs of surface temperature distribution observed in an actual residence were used to identify the thermal effect of the windbreak forest and surface materials. A coupled numerical simulation method of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and outdoor thermal simulation was used to evaluate the microclimate and thermal comfort in outdoor living spaces. The proposed simulation method was validated by comparing the simulated results with the measurement data. In addition, the residence was modeled using the coupled simulation program to quantify the microclimate and outdoor thermal comfort.

Forest fires have so far been considered as the most important disturbance but also other forms of disturbance such as insect outbreaks or wind-throw might contribute significantly to the largely unexplained inter-annual variability, at least in specific regions. The effect of wind-throw has not yet been estimated because of lack of data on how carbon fluxes are affected. The Gudrun storm, which hit Sweden in January 2005, resulted in ca. 66 million m3 of wind-thrown stem wood on an area of ca. 272000 ha. Using a model (BIOME-BGC) calibrated to CO2 flux measurements at two sites, the annual net ecosystem productivity during the first year after the storm was estimated to be in the range -897 to -1259 g Cm-2 yr-1. This is a much higher loss compared with harvested (clear-cut) forests in Europe, which ranged between ca. -420 and -100 gm-2 yr-1. The reduction in the carbon sink scaled to the whole wind-thrown area was estimated at ca. 3 milliontons C during the first year. By historical data on wind-throw in Europe combined with modelling, we estimated that the large Lothar storm in 1999 reduced the European carbon balance by ca. 16 milliontons C, this is ca. 30% of the net biome production in Europe. We conclude that the impact of increased forest damage by more frequent storms in future climate change scenarios must be considered and that intermittent large wind-throw events may explain a part of the large inter-annual variability in the terrestrial carbon sink. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Carbon balance; Eddy covariance; Gudrun; Modelling; Net ecosystem production; Respiration; Sweden; Wind-throw","annual variation; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; climate change; climate effect; eddy covariance; environmental disturbance; forest cover; forest fire; net ecosystem production; storm; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; Hexapoda","Lindroth, A.; Geobiosphere Science Centre, Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystems Analysis, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; email: anders.lindroth@nateko.lu.se",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-58549110456

The intensity of the damage was quite variable both between stands and between individual trees. Using visual assessment of tree crown health and dendrochronological techniques we examined the response to the ice storm of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) dominated forests in Gatineau Park, Quebec. Crown health assessment indicated that most of the heavily damaged trees showed some recovery in the years following the ice storm. However, dendrochronological analysis of the dominant sugar maples suggested that the most damaged individuals had still not returned to pre-ice storm stem growth levels six years following the ice storm. Combined, the crown health and dendrochronological analyses suggest that following the storm, in heavily damaged trees, resources were allocated to crown foliage production on remaining branches at the expense of stem growth.","Dendrochronology; Disturbance; Forest health; Ice storm","deciduous tree; dendrochronology; dominance; ecosystem health; environmental disturbance; growth response; health impact; ice storm; storm damage; Canada; Gatineau Park; North America; Quebec [Canada]; Acer; Acer saccharum","Pisaric, M.

Following the storm, another plot was established in an adjacent portion of the forest that was salvage-logged. Birds were inventoried on both plots through 2002. The original unsalvaged plot was prescribed-burned in 2004, but vegetation was surveyed through 2003, and through 2005 on the salvaged plot. We examined the effects of wind disturbance by comparing the pre-storm bird and vegetation communities with those developing afterwards through 2002 and 2003, respectively, and the effects of salvage logging by comparing vegetation and the bird community on the unsalvaged plot with those in the salvaged area. Wind reduced the canopy of the forest by over 90% with a temporary increase in the shrub layer, mostly resulting from tip-ups. Several plant species, including jack pine and beaked hazel (Corylus americana), appeared temporarily in the ground layer (<1 m height), but did not persist through 2003. Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) root sprouts were abundant in 2001, but decreased dramatically by 2003. Delayed mortality of tipped trees resulted in reduction of the shrub layer to pre-storm levels, and release of advanced regeneration black spruce and balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Bird species using the forest changed from dominance by canopy-foraging species to ground-brush foraging species, with an overall increase in bird diversity. Salvage logging resulted in significant reduction in coarse woody debris, and successful recruitment of jack pine seedlings. Quaking aspen sprouts were nearly 30 times more abundant in the salvage-logged area compared to the unsalvaged control. Ruderal species, especially red raspberry (Rubus ideaus), fringed bindweed (Polygonum cilinode), and several sedges (Carex spp.), were significantly more abundant after salvage logging. The bird community, on the other hand, was greatly diminished by salvage logging, with a reduction in diversity, density, and overall richness of species.","Bird diversity; Community structure; Salvage logging; Wind disturbance; Windthrow","Agricultural products; Biodiversity; Debris; Fruits; Harvesting; Logging (forestry); Vegetation; Wind effects; Advanced regeneration; Before and after; Bird communities; Bird diversity; Bird species; Boreal forests; Coarse woody debris; Community structure; Ground layer; Minnesota; Pine seedlings; Plant species; Red raspberry; Ruderal species; Salvage logging; Severe windstorm; Significant reduction; Vegetation communities; Wind disturbance; Windthrow; Forestry; bird; boreal forest; community response; community structure; coniferous forest; environmental disturbance; logging (timber); prescribed burning; salvaging; vegetation dynamics; wind forcing; windthrow; Biodiversity; Birds; Logging; Plants; Salvage; Wind; Abies; Abies balsamea; Aves; Carex; Convolvulus; Corylus; Corylus americana; Corylus cornuta; Picea mariana; Pinus banksiana; Polygonum; Polygonum cilinode; Populus tremuloides; Rubus glaucus; Rubus idaeus","Burris, J.M.; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 350 1st Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids, WI 54495, United States; email: John.M.Burris@gmail.com",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

During 2000-2003, 29,873 ground beetles represented by 71 species were caught in unbaited and baited pitfall traps in aspen/birch/conifer (ABC) and jack pine (JP) cover types. At the family level, both land-area treatment and cover type had significant effects on ground beetle trap catches, but there were no effects of pinenes and ethanol as baits. Six times more beetles were trapped in the burned forests than in the other land-area treatments; more beetles were caught in undisturbed than in wind-disturbed sites, and one-third more beetles were caught in the ABC than in the JP cover type. Thus, the windstorm generally reduced the activity-abundance of the beetles, but prescribed-burning increased it. Both salvaged and burned forest plots (especially in the ABC cover type) had the greatest species richness, diversity, and the most unique species assemblages. There was a highly similar ground beetle species composition (nearly 100%) between the ABC and JP burned forests, indicating that burning was a more primary driver of composition than cover type. At the species level, Pterostichus melanarius, an invasive ground beetle from Europe and a cover type generalist, was the most abundant beetle in the study (one-third of the total catch), and was caught in greatest numbers in burned forests. Removal of P. melanarius from the species composition analyses altered similarities among cover types and land-area treatments. Sphaeroderus nitidicollis brevoorti and Myas cyanescens were caught exclusively in the ABC and JP cover type, respectively; two rare pyrophilous species, Sericoda obsoleta and Sericoda quadripunctata, were only caught in burned sites; three forest species, Pterostichus coracinus, P. pensylvanicus, and Sphaeroderus lecontei, were caught more often in undisturbed JP sites; and two frequently trapped, open-habitat species, Agonum cupripenne and Poecilus l. lucublandus, were nearly absent from the undisturbed and wind-disturbed sites, as salvage-logging had a significant positive effect on their activity-abundance. Most species of Amara and Harpalus were trapped only in the salvaged or burned sites, indicating invasion of these disturbed sites by open-habitat species. We conclude that both the combined effect of fuel-reduction activities subsequent to the wind event and the numerical response of the invasive P. melanarius to habitat disturbances can alter the short-term succession of ground beetle assemblages in the sub-boreal forest.","Biodiversity; Carabidae; Forest management; Ground beetles; Invasive species; Pitfall trapping; Prescribed-fire; Pterostichus melanarius; Salvage-logging; Silviculture; Wind disturbance","Ethanol; Forestry; Harvesting; Logging (forestry); Ocean habitats; Biodiversity; Boreal forests; Carabidae; Coleoptera; Combined effects; Cover types; Forest management; Forest plots; Forest species; Ground beetles; Invasive species; Minnesota , USA; Numerical response; Pitfall trapping; Prescribed-fire; Pterostichus melanarius; Reduction treatments; Salvage-logging; Short-term effects; Silviculture; Species assemblages; Species compositions; Species richness; Wind disturbance; Ecology; anthropogenic effect; beetle; boreal forest; catastrophic event; community composition; coniferous forest; deciduous forest; environmental disturbance; forest management; invasive species; logging (timber); pitfall trap; prescribed burning; salvaging; silviculture; species diversity; species richness; succession; wind forcing; Biodiversity; Ecology; Forest Management; Harvesting; Insects; Logging; Silviculture; Wind; Minnesota; North America; United States; Agonum cupripenne; Carabidae; Coleoptera; Harpalus; Myas cyanescens; Pinus banksiana; Poecilus; Pterostichus coracinus; Pterostichus melanarius; Sericoda obsoleta; Sericoda quadripunctata; Sphaeroderus lecontei; Sphaeroderus nitidicollis","Seybold, S.J.; Department of Entomology, University of Minnesota, 219 Hodson Hall, 1980 Folwell Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55108, United States; email: sseybold@fs.fed.us",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

The focus of much of the research surrounding these species is to document the impacts of a single engineer on community composition and ecosystem processes. However, most ecosystems harbor multiple engineering species that interact in complex ways and rarely have the dynamics of such species been fully investigated. We look at how two ecosystem engineers, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and the invasive plant Japanese stilt grass (Microstegium vimineum), interact to completely alter the structure and composition of the subcanopy within northern deciduous forests. This interaction has wide-ranging repercussions on forest food webs which we explore through a case study of breeding woodland birds in the state of New Jersey, USA. We show that the guilds of birds that rely on the subcanopy have experienced greater declines from 1980 to 2005 than birds that specialize on the intact upper canopy of impacted forests. This dynamic is not restricted to immediate temporal effects and may act to derail the long-term successional pathway of northern deciduous forests. It is no longer prudent to set aside tracts of forest and expect them to retain their native biodiversity without active management. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Hutcheson Memorial Forest; Japanese stilt grass; Neotropical migrants; Understory; White-tailed deer","community composition; deciduous forest; deer; ecosystem engineering; ecosystem structure; environmental degradation; grass; invasive species; New Jersey; North America; United States; Aves; Microstegium vimineum; Odocoileus virginianus","Baiser, B.; Ecology, Evolution and Natural Resources, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, United States; email: bbaiser@msn.com",,,13873547,,BLINF,,"English","Biol.

The windthrow events caused varying damage among the studied stands, reducing tree density by 0.6-21.6 per cent and basal area by 0.2-10.4 per cent. The severity increased in proportion to decrease of uneven agedness of spruce and increase of productivity in the stands with share of spruce ≥90 per cent. The mixed stands where tree species composition was changing in favour of spruce dominance were less damaged. Following a disturbance, mortality did not differ among tree species and was influenced by tree size, with probability of mortality increasing with size. In the 20 years after windthrow, growing stock decreased, and stem density and regeneration both increased along with increased wind damage. Successional dynamics of the studied stands depended on the interplay between windthrow severity and stand attributes: age structure, tree species composition and site productivity. Four types of stands have been identified based on decreasing susceptibility to windthrow: even-aged productive spruce stands, uneven-aged low-to-medium productivity spruce stands, all-aged low-productivity spruce stands and even-aged productive mixed stands. © Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2008.

A case study was conducted on three management scenarios (no thinning, light thinning and heavy thinning) for sugi (Cryptomeria japonica (L.f.) D.Don) stands in Himi, Toyama Prefecture, Japan. The decision support approach integrated models and tools including a mechanistic/empirical wind damage risk assessment model ForestTYPHOON, which includes a modified version of the wind damage risk model, geographical analysis of the losses and effects of storms, and an airflow model, wind atlas analysis and application program. A growth model Silve-no-Mori was linked with ForestTYPHOON to estimate wind damage risk over a 50-year period. After assessing the wind damage risk, risk stands were displayed using a geographic information system. In addition, decision tree analysis provided information on stand characteristics related to wind damage. Approximately 90 per cent agreement was found between the wind damage assessment using ForestTYPHOON and the outputs of the decision trees. The decision trees showed that top height was the most important stand characteristic and provided a critical top height at which silvicultural treatments need to be modified.

Damage from intense winds may be especially severe in fragmented forests because of their abrupt artificial margins and denuded surrounding landscapes. We review available information on the effects of windstorms on fragmented forests, synthesizing studies from Australasia, Amazonia and elsewhere in the tropics. Wind damage in fragmented landscapes can be influenced by a range of factors, such as forest-edge orientation, edge structure, the size of nearby clearings and local topography. We argue that wind disturbances are likely to interact with, and exacerbate, a range of deleterious environmental changes in fragmented forests. Among the most important of these are altered forest structure, shifts in plant species composition, exotic-plant invasions, reduced carbon storage and elevated vulnerability to fire. The damaging impacts of winds on fragmented forests could potentially increase in the future, particularly if global warming leads to increasingly severe or frequent windstorms.","Edge effect; Forest dynamics; Habitat fragmentation; Plant functional trait; Windstorm resistance and resilience","carbon sequestration; community composition; edge effect; environmental disturbance; forest dynamics; global warming; habitat fragmentation; invasive species; literature review; storm damage; vulnerability; wind; Amazonia; Australasia; South America","Laurance, W.

The combination of two or more disturbances in a short period may produce ""ecological surprises,"" and models predict a threshold of cumulative disturbance severity above which forest composition will be drastically altered and regeneration may be impaired. Salvage logging (the harvesting of timber after natural disturbances; also called ""salvaging"" or ""sanitary logging"") is common, but there have been no tests of the manner in which salvaging after natural wind disturbance affects woody plant regeneration. Here we present findings from three years after a moderate-severity wind disturbance in west-central Tennessee, USA. We compare two unsalvaged sites and two sites that had intermediate-intensity salvaging. Our approach demonstrates the calculation of cumulative severity measures, which combine natural windthrow severity and anthropogenic tree cutting and removal, on a plot-by-plot basis. Seedling/sapling density and species richness were not influenced by cumulative disturbance severity, but species diversity showed a marginal increase with increasing cumulative severity. The amount of compositional change (from pre-disturbance trees to post-disturbance seedlings/saplings) increased significantly with cumulative severity of disturbance but showed no evidence of thresholds within the severity range examined. Overall, few deleterious changes were evident in these sites. Moderate-severity natural disturbances followed by moderate-intensity salvaging may have little detrimental effect on forest regeneration and diversity in these systems; the ecological surprises and threshold compositional change are more likely after combinations of natural and anthropogenic disturbances that have a much greater cumulative severity. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Diversity; Salvage; Wind disturbance; Wind severity; Woody plant regeneration","community composition; ecosystem response; environmental disturbance; forest management; human activity; logging (timber); salvaging; wind forcing; North America; Tennessee; United States; article; ecosystem; environmental protection; forestry; methodology; physiology; tree; United States; wind; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forestry; Tennessee; Trees; Wind","Peterson, C.

However, the functional spatial scale at which community composition is affected by landscape structure has never been explored. We assessed the functional spatial scales of composition change in birds and in three types of arthropod communities (canopy, forest-floor and flying ones) with regard to landscape heterogeneity resulting from a large typhoon in a temperate forest of Japan. We examined the effects of tree-fall disturbance on the communities at various spatial scales, with special attention to compositional evenness. The spatial scale of the best-fitting model, which was selected from models fitted to the disturbance area at stepwise spatial scales, was interpreted as the community-specific functional spatial scale. The composition of all communities studied was all significantly dependent on gap area. The functional spatial scale was highest in birds (370 m in radius), intermediate in flying arthropods (90 m) and lowest in canopy and forest-floor arthropods (10 m). This result may reflect typical dispersal ability and the spatial range of resource use in the community. Compositional changes in each community were consistent with theory regarding traits and responses of component taxa, although the enhancement of evenness was observed only in the arthropod communities. These results imply that management and reserve selection based on functional spatial scales can be effective in the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services at the community level. © 2007 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Arthropod communities; Bird community; Environmental heterogeneity; Scale dependence; Tree-fall gap","biodiversity; bird; community composition; community dynamics; community response; connectivity; deciduous forest; dispersal; environmental disturbance; landscape structure; modeling; temperate forest; Arthropoda; Aves","Hirao, T.; Tomakomai Research Station, Hokkaido University Forests, Takaoka, Tomakomai, Hokkaido 053-0035, Japan; email: hirao@fsc.hokudai.ac.jp",,,09123814,,ECRSE,,"English","Ecol.

The managers must estimate stormwater quality and quantities from forested watersheds to develop effective management strategies. Therefore, stormwater runoff loads and concentrations of 10 constituents (total suspended solids, dissolved organic carbon, PO4-P, dissolved total phosphorus, total phosphorus, NH4-N, NO2-N, NO3-N, dissolved total nitrogen, and total nitrogen) for 72 events across five regions (Aichi, Kochi, Mie, Nagano, and Tokyo) were characterised. Most loads were significantly and positively correlated with stormwater variables (total event rainfall, event duration, and rainfall intensity), but most discharge-weighted event concentrations (DWECs) showed negative correlations with rainfall intensity. Mean water quality concentration during baseflow was correlated significantly with storm concentrations (r = 0.41-0.77). Although all pollutant load equations showed high coefficients of determination (R2 = 0.55-0.80), no models predicted well pollutant concentrations, except those for the three N constituents (R2 = 0.59-0.67). Linear regressions to estimate stormwater concentrations and loads were greatly improved by regional grouping. The lower prediction capability of the concentration models for Mie, compared with the other four regions, indicated that other watershed or storm characteristics should be included in the prediction models. Significant differences among regions were found more frequently in concentrations than in loads for all constituents. Since baseflow conditions implied available pollutant sources for stormwater, the similar spatial characteristics of pollutant concentrations between baseflow and stormflow conditions were an important control for stormwater quality. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Prescriptions and monitoring for thinning generally focus on biotic characteristics of vegetation, like tree density, rather than abiotic characteristics of soils and their loss, which are usually only considered in association with water erosion. Recent studies indicate that sediment transport by wind in forests is substantial and can exceed water transport, yet forest wind erosion responses to tree thinning and/or burning are unknown. We measured wind-driven horizontal dust flux, a metric related to wind erosion, with respect to presence/absence of fire and/or thinning in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in northern New Mexico, USA. Passive dust collectors at several sampling heights documented elevated dust fluxes at sites that were burned and/or thinned. Unexpectedly, thinned sites had erosion rates as large as burned sites, documenting significant restoration impacts on soil stability. Thinning and fire impacts on dust flux were correlated with remaining tree or ground cover. The results highlight that dust fluxes provide a readily measurable metric of soil stability that should be integrated into prescription and monitoring plans for forest restoration and thinning. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the scale-dependent effects of windthrow disturbance caused by a large typhoon on three arthropod communities in a temperate forest of Japan. Canopy arthropods were collected by beating foliage, forest-floor arthropods were collected by sweeping the vegetation, and flying arthropods were collected in Malaise traps. To assess the ""functional spatial scale"" at which arthropods responded to tree-fall disturbance, the gap rate was quantified at different spatial scales by sequentially enlarging the radius of a circular landscape sector in 10-m increments from 10 to 500 m. We then analyzed the responses of order richness and abundance to the gap rate for each arthropod community. The spatial scale of the significant best-fitting model, which was selected from the models fitted to the gap rate at stepwise spatial scales, was regarded as the arthropod-specific functional spatial scale. Arthropod order richness was not dependent on the gap rate. In contrast, arthropod order abundance depended significantly on the gap rate in many orders, but varied in the response direction and functional spatial scale. These order-specific, scale-dependent responses to tree-fall gaps could complicate interactions among organisms, leading to complex community organization. An understanding of the spatial processes that link the use of space by organisms with the spatial scale at which ecological processes are experienced is required to elucidate the responses of populations, communities, and biotic interactions to disturbances in a spatial landscape context. © 2007 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Arthropod diversity; Environmental heterogeneity; Functional spatial scale; Scale dependence; Tree-fall gap","abundance; arthropod; community composition; forest floor; heterogeneity; species diversity; species richness; typhoon; windthrow; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; Arthropoda","Hirao, T.; Tomakomai Research Station, Hokkaido University Forests, Takaoka, Tomakomai, Hokkaido 053-0035, Japan; email: hirao@fsc.hokudai.ac.jp",,,09123814,,ECRSE,,"English","Ecol.

In 1996, stands of Börzsöny Mts, Hungary were hit by a severe ice storm, then by strong winds three years later. Affected areas were mapped on aerial photos, and we built a GIS database containing variables describing topography and tree stand characteristics. The role of variables in predicting ice break and windfall was investigated by non-parametric statistical tests and by a series of C&RT (Classification and Regression Tree) analyses. Elevation, aspect and slope proved to have strong statistical relationships with the distribution of both ice break and windfall, with misclassification error (MER) of 18% and 15%, respectively, if studied without stand descriptors. Mixing ratio and age of beech were the most important stand descriptors to explain the distribution of ice break (MER=15%), whereas that of windfall was best described by the age and height of the two dominant tree species (MER=11%). The explanatory power could be increased if all variables (topographic + stand descriptors) were considered, though the increase in explanatory power was higher in the case of ice break (MER decreased from 15% to 11%) than for windfall (MER decreased from 11 % to 10%). Since management related stand variables (beech mixture ratio, age, height, amount of recently felled stock, slenderness) and susceptibility to disturbance events seemed to be related, our results suggest that the sensitivity of tree stands could be decreased by increasing compositional and structural heterogeneity. © Akadémiai Kiadó.","Beech; C&RT; Fagus sylvatica; Ice break; Quercus petraea; Sessile oak; Windthrow","aerial photography; database; deciduous tree; environmental disturbance; forest management; GIS; ice; stand dynamics; topographic effect; tree; wind; windthrow; Borzsony Mountains; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Hungary; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Quercus petraea","Standovár, T.; Department of Plant Taxonomy and Ecology, L.

Patterns of tree mortality as influenced by species, diameter and stand age were assessed across a gradient in wind disturbance intensity in a southern boreal forest in Minnesota, USA. Few previous studies have addressed how wind impacts boreal forests where fire was historically the dominant type of disturbance. 2. We surveyed 29 334 trees of nine species within a 236 000 ha blowdown in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), in forests that have never been logged and were not salvaged after the windstorm. Within the disturbed area, a range of disturbance severity from zero to complete canopy mortality was present, overlaying an existing mosaic of fire origin stands. For this study, we derived an index of wind disturbance intensity by standardizing the observed disturbance severity using common species with similar diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) distributions. We then used multiple logistic regression to assess patterns of tree mortality across gradients in tree size and wind intensity index, and for three stand ages. 3. Probability of mortality was higher with increasing ln d.b.h. for all nine species, with two species (Abies balsamea and Picea mariana) showing much more dramatic shifts in mortality with d.b.h. than the others. As hypothesized, the species most susceptible to windthrow at all d.b.h. classes were early successional and shade intolerant (Pinus banksiana, Pinus resinosa, Populus tremuloides) and those least susceptible were generally shade tolerant (e.g. Thuja occidentalis, Acer rubrum), although the intolerant species Betula papyrifera also had low mortality. 4. Mortality rates were higher in mature (c. 90 years old) stands than for old and very old (c. 126-200 years old) stands, probably because old stands had already gone through transition to a multi-aged stage of development. 5. Synthesis. Quantification of canopy mortality patterns generally supports disturbance-mediated accelerated succession following wind disturbance in the southern boreal forest. This wind-induced weeding of the forest favoured Thuja occidentalis, Betula papyrifera and Acer rubrum trees of all sizes, along with small Abies balsamea and Picea mariana trees. Overall, the net impact of wind disturbance must concurrently consider species mortality probability, abundance and diameter distributions. © 2007 The Authors.","Boreal forest; Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW); Forest dynamics; Mortality; Stand age; Susceptibility; Wind disturbance; Wind-throw","boreal forest; environmental disturbance; evergreen tree; mortality; storm; Minnesota; North America; United States; Abies; Abies balsamea; Acer; Acer rubrum; Betula papyrifera; Picea mariana; Pinus banksiana; Pinus resinosa; Populus tremuloides; Thuja occidentalis","Rich, R.L.; Department of Forest Resources, University of Minnesota, 1530 Cleveland Avenue North, St. Paul, MN 55108, United States; email: rich0475@umn.edu",,,00220477,,JECOA,,"English","J.

This was done by integrating a forest growth model SIMA and a mechanistic wind damage model HWIND into geographical information system software (ArcGIS 8.2) as a toolbar (DLL) using ArcObjects in ArcGIS and Visual Basic 6. In this DSS complex problems are solved within program so that forest gaps, edge stands and edges are automatically tracked when the forest structure changes over time as a result of forest growth dynamics and management. This DSS can be used to assess the risk of wind damage to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula spp.) stands, regarding the number of stands and area at risk and length of vulnerable edges of these risk stands at certain critical wind speed classes (i.e. corresponding the maximum wind speed a tree/stand can resist).

In this study, we examined the immediate impact of moderate-intensity wind storms on stand structure, opening sizes, and light regimes in three hemlock-hardwood forests of northeastern Wisconsin. These were compared to three stands managed by single-tree and group selection, the predominant forest management system for northern hardwoods in the region. Wind storms removed an average of 41% of the stand basal area, compared to 27% removed by uneven-aged harvests, but both disturbances removed trees from a wide range of size classes. The removal of nearly half of the large trees by wind in two old-growth stands caused partial retrogression to mature forest structure, which has been hypothesized to be a major disturbance pathway in the region. Wind storms resulted in residual stand conditions that were much more heterogeneous than in managed stands. Gap sizes ranged from less than 10 m2 up to 5000 m2 in wind-disturbed stands, whereas the largest opening observed in managed stands was only 200 m2. Wind-disturbed stands had, on average, double the available solar radiation at the forest floor compared to managed stands. Solar radiation levels were also more heterogeneous in wind-disturbed stands, with six times more variability at small scales (0.1225 ha) and 15 times more variability at the whole-stand level. Modification of uneven-aged management regimes to include occasional harvests of variable intensity and spatial pattern may help avoid the decline in species diversity that tends to occur after many decades of conventional uneven-aged management. At the same time, a multi-cohort system with these properties would retain a high degree of average crown cover, promote structural heterogeneity typical of old-growth forests, and maintain dominance by late-successional species. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Ecosystem management; Forest canopy gaps; Forest light regimes; Forest stand dynamics; Moderate-severity disturbance; Northern hardwoods; Old-growth forest; Stand development; Wind storm effects; Windthrow","canopy gap; catastrophic event; comparative study; dominance; ecosystem management; environmental disturbance; forest floor; forest management; gap dynamics; old-growth forest; solar radiation; species diversity; stand dynamics; wind forcing; windthrow; North America; United States; Wisconsin; Conium; rain; article; cohort analysis; comparative study; disaster; ecosystem; forestry; methodology; North America; wind; Cohort Studies; Ecosystem; Forestry; Natural Disasters; North America; Rain; Wind","Hanson, J.J.; Department of Forest Ecology and Management, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1630 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706-1598, United States; email: jacobhanson@wisc.edu",,,10510761,,ECAPE,"17708211","English","Ecol.

We recorded the vegetation in 57 pairs of disturbed and adjacent undisturbed plots and established a chronosequence of mound ages to study the effect of time since microsite formation on plant species richness and composition. We found significant differences in plant species richness and composition between disturbed and adjacent undisturbed plots. Species richness of both vascular plants and bryophytes was higher in the disturbed than in the undisturbed plots, but these differences were more pronounced for bryophytes. We suggest that three main factors are responsible for this differential response. The availability of microsites on the forest floor that are suitable for the recruitment of bryophytes is lower than for vascular plants. Establishment of bryophytes in disturbed microsites is favoured by a greater abundance of propagules in the close vicinity and in the soil of the disturbed microsites, as well as by a greater variety of regeneration strategies in bryophytes than in vascular plants. Time since mound formation was a major factor determining plant species richness and composition. A significant decrease in the mean number of species was found from young mounds to intermediate and old mounds. However, differences were observed between vascular plants and bryophytes in the course of changes through time in species richness and composition. A large number of exclusive and infrequent vascular plant species was observed on young mounds, among them several disturbance specialists. We suggest that the establishment of many vascular plant species was infrequent and short-lived due to unfavourable light conditions and a low abundance of propagules. By contrast, the development of a litter layer was the main reason for the decreased mean number of bryophytes on old mounds. Our study supports the view that groups of species differing in important life history traits exhibit different responses to soil disturbance. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Bryophytes; Fagus sylvatica; Pits and mounds; Small-scale disturbance; Tree uprooting; Vascular plant species","abundance; bryophyte; chronosequence; community composition; dicotyledon; environmental disturbance; hill; life history trait; litter; propagule; recruitment; regeneration; seedling establishment; soil depth; species richness; vascular plant; windthrow; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Bryophyta; bryophytes; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Tracheophyta","Von Oheimb, G.; Institute of Ecology and Environmental Chemistry, University of Lüneburg, Scharnhorststr. 1, 21335 Lüneburg, Germany; email: vonoheimb@uni-lueneburg.de",,,13850237,,PLECF,,"English","Plant Ecol.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250203584

We used a simulation model to evaluate forest succession, forest structure and the protective effect in subalpine blowdown areas after 50 simulation years under different scenarios. The scenarios included the effects of different management strategies such as clearing the fallen logs or leaving the sites untouched (""uncleared""), variations in seed supply, and ungulate browsing. The simulation results indicated that forest structure was heterogeneous after 50 years, with a high amount of trees between 11 and 100 cm height, and a low amount of trees taller than 1 m. The number of trees >5 m, which is important for the protective effect of a site, was lower at uncleared areas if the area was covered with high amounts of fallen logs, but diversity of microsites was higher than at cleared areas. We found that it is particularly important that abundant seed supply occurs within the first few years after the blowdown at cleared sites, because in later stages there was high competition by tall herbs, which prevented the establishment of tree regeneration. Larger time lags between seed years in the simulations led to retarded tree regeneration. Particularly at cleared sites, ungulate browsing retarded tree regeneration. In contrast, uncleared sites had a higher potential to recover from high browsing pressure due to a high amount of favourable microsites that are provided by decaying logs. These results of our model simulations may help understanding the dynamics of forest regeneration and providing perspectives for management after blowdown events. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Before the ice storm, most microsites received between 2 and 4%PPFD. Following the ice storm, the stand-level mean %PPFD increased four- to five-fold, ranging from 13.8 to 20.5%PPFD, from 0.3 to 4 m aboveground. Despite its magnitude, the post-ice storm increase in light transmission was short-lived. By 1999 (2-year+), the mean light levels had decreased by half, and recovery to pre-storm conditions occurred within 3-7 years, depending on height. The decrease in light transmission during the post-disturbance years followed an inverse J-shape trend, indicating more dynamic changes early after disturbance. By 2004 (7-year+), light levels at ≤2 m had become slightly but significantly lower than before the ice storm, with most microsites receiving <2%PPFD. The ice storm led to a synchronized increase of the light levels at almost all understory locations, which might allow a high proportion of the advanced regeneration to experience a release. However, due to the rapid recovery of the light conditions to levels similar or lower than before the ice storm, this disturbance should be more advantageous to shade-tolerant species. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Formerly prominent in the southeastern US, canebrakes are dense stands of the bamboos collectively called ""cane"" [Arundinaria (Michx)]. Canebrakes are now a critically endangered component of the bottomland hardwood forest ecosystem. Cane still occurs in its historic range, primarily in small remnant patches. A poor understanding of the ecological processes that generated large canebrakes limits their restoration and management. We hypothesize that cane's spreading clonal structure enables these bamboos to persist beneath a forest canopy and then respond rapidly to large-scale wind disturbances. We quantified patterns of clonal growth in one cane species, ""giant cane"" [Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.], in a very large tornado-generated canopy gap and in surrounding bottomland hardwood forest in Louisiana. We tested these four hypotheses over a 12-month study period in the large canopy gap: (1) production of new culms should be greater, (2) clonal expansion should be greater, (3) culm damage rate should be reduced, and (4) culm size should be reduced compared to giant cane stands under forest canopy. We found that new culm production in tornado-blowdown plots was twice that in forest plots. Accordingly, culms were younger on average in the tornado blowdown than under forest. Rate of clonal expansion was similar between the two environments, suggesting clonal spread was not disturbance-dependent. With fewer branch-fall impacts, culms in the tornado blowdown were less often damaged. Culms were smaller in tornado-blowdown plots than in forest plots. Giant cane's clonal plasticity should enable it to persist in old-growth bottomland forests by responding to local light conditions. Genets should increase culm production in small gaps and senesce as gaps fill in. Giant cane stands could thereby shift location over time. Wind disturbance that opens forest canopy should trigger redevelopment of denser stands that could merge with other expanding stands into expansive canebrakes. Giant cane's clonal ecology may be a useful model for understanding spreading bamboos and other forest-growing clonal perennials. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To test whether thigmomorphogenesis is evident at different scales within plants, we investigated the effect of wind on allometric relationships between specific plant parts. We chose two species from the elfin cloud forest of Puerto Rico that have contrasting growth habits, the shrub Clibadiun erosum (Asteraceae) and the palm Prestoea acuminata var. montana (Arecaceae), and subjected them to barrier-protected and wind-exposed treatments. For C. erosum, we compared the allometry of stems and branches against three allometric models that predict that plant height or branch length increases at the 1, 2/3, and 1/2 power of stem diameter. Only the geometric similarity model (scaling exponent of 1) seemed to hold when plants were exposed to the wind. We found relatively fewer leaves per number of branches produced and fewer leaves per increment of branch diameter in the plants of C. erosum exposed to the wind.

The primary goal of the study was to determine whether a small watershed in the Appalachian region (USA) that was recently subjected to surface mining and reclamation practices produces stormflow responses to rain events that are different from those produced by a nearby reference watershed covered by young, second-growth forest. Water balances indicated that runoff yields did not vary significantly between the two watersheds on an annual basis. Statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in runoff responses were observed on an event basis, however, with the mined/reclaimed watershed producing, on average (a) higher storm runoff coefficients (2.5×), (b) greater total storm runoff (3×), and (c) higher peak hourly runoff rates (2×) when compared with the reference watershed. Results of a unit hydrograph analysis also showed, unexpectedly, that the modelled unit responses of the two watersheds to effective rainfall pulses were similar, despite the noted differences in land cover. Differences in stormflow responses were thus largely explained by dramatic reductions in cumulative rates of rainfall abstraction (measured using infiltrometers) attributable to soil compaction during land reclamation. Additional field hydrological measurements on other mined watersheds will be needed to generalize our results, as well as to understand and predict the cumulative hydrological impacts of widespread surface mining in larger watersheds and river basins.

Conceptual models of the effects of wind disturbance have traditionally focused on the impacts of catastrophic disturbances and have painted a simple picture of how disturbance acts to maintain tree species diversity. These models ignore variation among species characteristics that could have important consequences for both resistance to and recovery from disturbance. 2 We integrated an empirically parameterized, mechanistic model of windstorm mortality (WINDSTORM) and a seed-mass-based dispersal and recruitment model into a spatially explicit, individual tree model of forest dynamics (SORTIE) in order to create simulated long-term 'experiments' designed to explore the sensitivity of forest composition and structure to species-specific resistance to and recovery from disturbance. 3 We found that species-specific variation in resistance to wind mortality interacted strongly with: (i) shade tolerance characteristics, (ii) the medium-term history of disturbances, (iii) the long-term average severity of the disturbance regime and (iv) seedbed substrate dynamics to influence tree population dynamics and successional trajectories. 4 We also examined how local and long-distance dispersal affect response to wind disturbance. Ignoring differences among local dispersal characteristics overestimates the importance of dispersal-limited species. Our results show that long-distance immigration maintains species coexistence only if the immigration rate is very high relative to local dispersal. Despite this, stand-scale models that ignore long-distance dispersal can underestimate population dynamics of dispersal-limited species. 5 Our results indicate that landscape-scale heterogeneity in structure and species composition in these forests is facilitated by synergisms between the stochastic nature of wind disturbance and complex interactions between species traits that govern: (i) resistance to disturbance, (ii) local dispersal and seedling establishment and (iii) competitive (i.e. growth/survival) traits that do not adhere to strict tradeoffs. 6 We conclude that wind disturbance has much more complex and variable effects on long-term dynamics of forest structure and composition than suggested by previous models. In particular, non-catastrophic disturbances can generate important variation in forest dynamics that can either lead to dominance by a single or small number of species, or facilitate species coexistence. © 2006 The Authors.","Community dynamics; Competition; Disturbance; Forerst ecology; Local and long-distance seed dispersal; Resistance to disturbance; Seedling establishment; Simulation model; Succession; Wind disturbance","community response; environmental disturbance; shade tolerance; simulation; species diversity; temperate forest; wind stress; North America","Papaik, M.J.; University of Quebec at Montreal, CP 8888 Succ.

The short-term effect of these gaps for saproxylic beetle abundance, species richness and assemblage composition were compared with closed-forest stands and seedling-sapling stands. We observed a strong differentiation of saproxylic assemblage in gaps compared with undisturbed stands but richness was only slightly higher in gaps. Contrary to expectations, the abundance of primary wood consumers on the whole, highly dominated by bark beetles, was as high in undisturbed plots as in gaps. However, longhorn and buprestid beetles responded positively in gaps. The later-successional xylophagous beetles on the whole were not significantly less abundant in gaps, in spite of the lower abundance of some shade-preferring species (Anobiidae, Eucnemidae, Melandryidae). Gap changes had a positive impact on the floricolous and xylomycetophagous insects, even if the species response was contrasted. Saproxylic communities were also distinct in gaps and in seedling-sapling stands. Both species richness and number of characteristic species were higher in gaps than in seedling-sapling stands. The abundance of later-successional xylophagous and xylomycetophagous insects was equal in gaps and in seedling-sapling stands. The abundance of saproxylic predators seemed to follow the population levels of all xylophagous insects. Because of their richness and faunistic dissimilarity with other open stands and closed-canopy controls, uncleared gaps may enhance the gamma diversity at the forest scale. In response to management issues underlying this research project, saproxylic diversity would benefit from the maintenance of some uncleared gaps. Moreover, in managed temperate, deciduous forests, my results suggest to retain more sun-exposed harvesting residue in fellings in order to enhance biodiversity. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The main gap effects did not increase with gap area. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) and ANOSIM tests showed that all gaps, even small, differed from closed-canopy controls in terms of saproxylic species composition. However, only mid-size gaps were distinct from large and especially small gaps. The highest Bray-Curtis dissimilarity occurred between mid-size gaps and closed-canopy controls, and not between large gaps and controls. Partly in agreement with the resource concentration hypothesis, floricolous beetles were more abundant in mid-size and large gaps than in small ones. However, pioneer xylophagous species did not increase and late-successional xylophagous species did not decrease in abundance with increasing gap area. A peak in cumulative and mean local species richness was measured in mid-size gaps, but assemblage composition in mid-size gaps was not intermediate between small and large gaps, which does not fully comply with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. From IndVal results, no strictly characteristic species were detected in small gaps, but several ones in mid-sized and large gaps. On the whole, scolytids and pioneer xylophagous beetles were favoured in gaps by an increase in felling density in the 78 and 314 ha surrounding landscapes, respectively. Individual species responses in occurrence or abundance were varied. As the faunistic peculiarity in the gaps was mainly confined to mid- and large-sized gaps, retaining uncleared gaps above 0.5 ha in size is recommended to improve saproxylic gamma diversity in forests. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Average crown loss of over 75% was recorded in large areas of eastern Ontario and southern Quebec. A primary question that arose following the storm was: can forest damage be effectively assessed using remote sensing and other available environmental data? This paper presents two contrasting studies to address this question. The first involves damage modelling at a local scale in an unmanaged forest using spectral and spatial information in high-resolution airborne imagery. Results of field data analyses are also given that show relations between damage and forest structure and composition as well as changes in forest structure that occurred in the years following the storm. The second study involves regional scale damage mapping in managed and unmanaged forests of eastern Ontario using medium resolution satellite imagery and other environmental data. In comparison of several image classification and data interpolation methods, the best damage map was produced using a neural network classifier and a mix of Landsat and environmental data. The methods and results presented in this paper form the basis for ongoing long-term temporal study of damage impacts on forest condition. © Springer 2005.","Forest damage; Ice storm; Remote sensing and environmental data; Spectral and spatial image analysis","forest; ice storm; mapping; remote sensing; Canada; North America; Ontario; Quebec [Canada]; Western Hemisphere; World","King, D.J.; Department of Geography and Environmental Studies, Carleton University, 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, Ont.

However, the effects of this natural disturbance on ambrosia and bark beetle communities are poorly known. In managed oak-hornbeam forests storm-damaged in France in 1999, we sampled ambrosia (and second bark beetles) by ethanol-baited window-flight traps in 2001. By comparing uncleared gaps, undisturbed closed-canopy controls and seedling-sapling stands, we investigated the short-term effects of gap formation, gap size and surrounding landscape to provide a snapshot of scolytid response. Contrary to expectations, neither the abundance nor the richness of ambrosia beetle species was significantly higher in gaps than in undisturbed stands. Few responses in abundance at the species level and only a slight difference in assemblage composition were detected between gaps and closed-canopy controls. Gaps were more dissimilar from seedling-sapling stands, than from closed-canopy controls. More scolytid individuals and species were caught in gaps than in seedling-sapling stands. Mean local and cumulative richness peaked in mid-size gaps. Only mid-size gaps differed from closed-canopy controls in terms of species composition. We identified generalist gap species (Xyleborus saxesenii, X. cryptographus), but also species significantly more abundant in mid-size gaps (Platypus cylindrus, Xyloterus signatus). The faunistic peculiarity of mid-size gaps seemed to be partly related to a bias in oak density among gap size classes. Few landscape effects were observed. Only the scolytids on the whole and X. dispar were slightly favoured by an increasing density in fellings at the 78 ha scale. We did not find any correlation between scolytid abundance and the surrounding closed-forest percentage area. We confirmed that temperate, deciduous, managed stands did not come under threat by ambrosia and bark beetle pests after the 1999 windstorm. Nonetheless, our data stressed the current expansion in Western Europe of two invasive species, X. peregrinus and especially X. germanus, now the predominant scolytid in the three oak forests studied. © 2005 Blackwell Verlag.","Dead wood retention; Forest management; Natural disturbance; Pest risk; Windthrow gaps","beetle; canopy gap; community dynamics; temperate forest; windthrow; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; France; Western Europe; World; Ambrosia; Carpinus; Coleoptera; Peregrinus; Platypodidae; Platypus (beetle); Platypus cylindrus; Scolytinae; Xyleborus; Xyleborus cryptographus; Xyleborus dispar; Xyleborus germanus; Xyleborus peregrinus; Xyleborus saxesenii; Xyloterus","Bouget, C.; Forest Ecosystems, Biodiversity and Management of Lowland Forests, Institute for Engineering in Agriculture and Environment (CEMAGREF), Domaine des Barres, F-45 290 Nogent-sur-Vernisson, France; email: christophe.bouget@nogent.cemagref.fr",,,09312048,,JOAEE,,"English","J.

These records contain information on the location and extent of heavy windthrows and stand-replacing fires prior to Euro-American settlement. The spatial patterns of windthrow and fire were spatially clustered at all scales in this historical environment, with stronger associations at local than regional scales. Logistic regression shows environmental variables to have a strong influence on this pattern. In the case of heavy windthrow, environmental drivers of disturbance pattern are fairly consistent across the region. The effects of climate and vegetation are predominant at all scales, but effects are often indirect, with strong interactions between them. Interactions between these two drivers and soil characteristics are also sometimes present. In contrast, models of stand-replacing fire show simple and direct control within and across fire-prone landscapes of historical northern Wisconsin, with climate and physiography as the main factors explaining the distribution of fire disturbance. This simple and direct control is lost at the regional scale, where climate, physiographic, soil, and vegetation variables, along with interactions between them, are significant factors. Contrary to other regions, the topographic effects are generally not important in predicting either wind or fire disturbance. Our work suggests that, in landscapes that lack strong environmental patterning, climate maintains its role as a primary driver of these natural disturbances, but topography is replaced by interactions and feedbacks with other forms of environmental heterogeneity. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Fire disturbance; Logistic regression; Multiscale; Northern US Lake States; Pre-Euro-American settlement; Spatial autocorrelation; US Public Land Survey; US upper Midwest; Wind disturbance","disturbance; fire history; forest ecosystem; historical ecology; spatial analysis; windthrow; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; Wisconsin; World","Schulte, L.A.; Dept. of Nat.

Forest susceptibility to maritime windstorms was determined by applying a wind-disturbance model (WINDSTORM) to two study areas where bear dens had been identified by radio telemetry. We evaluated model predictions for forest structure against field data for one study area. As predicted, forests in wind-protected landscapes contained features indicative of later stages of forest development where larger and older trees are more abundant. By contrast, forests located in storm-susceptible locations contained higher tree densities, less variation in tree diameters, smaller trees, and less evidence of large, old trees with heart rot. Analysis of habitat use relative to its availability on the landscape indicates that bears selected wind-protected landscapes over storm-prone landscapes in both study areas for winter dens. The majority (58%) of den sites were located in forests most protected from catastrophic storm effects. By contrast, only 6% were located in forests most exposed to storm damage. Results suggest that forests most protected from catastrophic windstorm disturbance contain more suitable overwinter habitat for black bears as evidenced by den site selection. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","Black bear denning ecology; Disturbance; Forest dynamics; Forest succession; Spatially explicit models; Telemetry; Windthrow; Winter den site selection","bear; environmental disturbance; forest dynamics; site selection; stand structure; telemetry; windthrow; Alaska; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Ursus americanus","DeGayner, E.J.; USDA Forest Service, 626 East Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53201, United States; email: edegayner@fs.fed.us",,"Ecological Society of America",10510761,,ECAPE,,"English","Ecol.

Visual damage estimates in 104 plots and corresponding reflectance and environmental data were divided into multiple, mutually exclusive training and reference datasets for damage classification evaluation. Damage classification accuracy was compared among four methods: multiple regression, linear discriminant analysis, maximum likelihood, and neural networks. Using the best classifier, various stratification methods were assessed for potential inflationary effects on classification accuracy due to spatial proximity between training and reference data. Of the classifiers that were evaluated, neural networks performed best. Neural networks 'learn' training data accurately (94% overall), but classify proximate reference data less accurately (65%), and distant, spatially independent reference data least accurately (55%). Results indicate that, while remotely sensed and environmental data cannot discriminate among many levels of deciduous ice storm damage, they can by considered useful for differentiating areas of low to medium damage from areas of severe damage (69% accuracy). Such classification methods can provide regional damage maps more objectively than point-based visual estimates or aerial sketch mapping and aid in identification of areas of severe damage where management intervention may be advantageous. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In this study the membrane electrolyte leakages, expressed as injury indices, of 9 windward species, 9 leeward species, and 5 ubiquitous species were determined and used as measures of dehydration tolerance. The leaf mass per area (LMA) of these species was also measured. The windward species had sclerophyllous leaves with LMA values between 14 and 24 mg cm-2. LMA values of the leeward species were between 5 and 9 mg cm-2 only. When subjected to water stress, leaves of the windward species exhibited lower injury indices than leaves of the leeward species, indicating that the windward species had higher dehydration tolerance. Leaves of the leeward species, Ficus fistulosa, Helicia formosana, and Dysoxylum hongkongense, exhibited the greatest injury indices; in contrast, those of the windward species, Gordonia axillars and Myrsine sequinii, showed the least injury indices among all species tested. Dehydration tolerance and LMA values of the 5 ubiquitous species were between those of the windward and leeward species. In addition, a positive, significant relationship between LMA and dehydration tolerance of the 23 species was found. Sclerophyllous leaves of the windward species with relatively higher LMA values seemed to be able to reduce physical damage produced by the monsoon winds, and physiologically enhance dehydration tolerance. Both characteristics may play important roles in the ability of windward species to cope with windward environmental conditions in Nanjenshan Forest.","Electrolyte leakage; Injury index; Northeasterly monsoon; Sclerophyll; Wind stress","Dehydration; Electrolytes; Water; Wind stress; Dehydration tolerance; Dysoxylum hongkongense; Ficus fistulosa; Helicia formosana; Injury index; Leaf mass per area; Membrane electrolyte leakage; Northeasterly monsoon; Sclerophyll; Forestry; Dehydration; Electrolytes; Ficus; Forestry; Forests; Leaves; Trees; Water; Wind; Dysoxylum; Helicia; Myrsine","Kuo, Y.-L.; Department of Forestry, Natl.

These factors may interact in shaping coastal ecosystems. The occurrence of a violent storm and a historic drought during an 8-year study of sea-level rise effects on coastal forest in west central Florida presented an opportunity to study these interactions. The system studied was a marshy coastline, on a tectonically stable, karstic limestone platform, where coastal hydric hammock (a wetland hardwood forest) abutted salt marsh. Both the storm and the drought that occurred during the study were associated with pulses of tree mortality that selectively removed Juniperus virginiana var. silicicola (southern red cedar) from stands. Stable isotope data suggested that these trees used less fresh ground water and more sea water as these stands declined in the face of rising sea level. Drought-associated tree death only occurred in a stand in very late stages of sea-level-induced decline, where ground water became hypersaline during the drought. A storm that occurred in 1993 also selectively removed Juniperus from stands, damaging stands primarily in areas where tree reproduction had already ceased or declined due to sea-level rise. Thus, although these episodic events (drought and storm) caused notable tree death, the projected inability of forest stands to recover from these events was due to prior effects of sea-level rise.","Aquifer; Cabbage palm; Coastal hydric hammock; Gulf of Mexico; Juniperus virginiana var. silicicola; Sabal palmetto; Salinity; Southern red cedar; Stable isotopes","coastal zone; ecosystem response; environmental change; global change; salinity; sea level change; submerged vegetation; Florida; North America; United States; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Juniperus; Juniperus virginiana silicicola; Sabal; Sabal palmetto","Williams, K.; Department of Biology, California State University, San Bernardino, CA 94705, United States; email: williams@csusb.edu",,,07490208,,JCRSE,,"English","J.

Such excavations were made around 1984 in the upper shore regions of a forest near Darwin in northern Australia. To determine whether changes near the channels appeared to be affecting the mangroves, we measured the survival of experimentally planted seedlings, vegetation structure and a set of environmental variables at several distances from the channels. We focused primarily on Ceriops australis, the most common species. Surface and sub-surface (30 cm) soil salinity, pH and moisture showed no consistent pattern with distance from channels but measurements before and after spring tides showed significantly greater changes in these soil parameters in the surface than in the sub-surface. The survival of planted C. australis seedlings was lower in the forests immediately adjacent to the channels than in forests further away. The growth of the seedlings, however, did not depend on location. Total basal area increased with distance from channels. The forests adjacent to some channels had a greater proportion of Lumnitzera racemosa and Avicennia marina. Although no consistent patterns were evident in soil variables, some patterns in the vegetation, and poorer survival of the seedlings, suggest that the channels might be negatively impacting C. australis. If this was the case, the effects on the forest were, however, relatively minor and apparently similar to those of natural channels.","Ceriops australis; Drainage channels; Mangrove; Northern Australia; Tidal innundation","Drainage; Excavation; Forestry; Ocean habitats; Soils; Vegetation; Breeding habitats; Plants (botany); Avicennia; Avicennia marina; Ceriops; Ceriops australis; Lumnitzera; Lumnitzera racemosa; Rhizophoraceae","Moritz-Zimmermann, A.; EWL Sciences Pty Ltd., PO Box 39443, Winnellie, North.

Costly structural retrofits of urbanized watersheds can mitigate certain problems, such as flooding or erosion, but cannot restore the predevelopment flow regime or habitat conditions. Widespread conversion of forest to pasture or grass in rural areas, generally unregulated by most jurisdictions, degrades aquatic systems even when watershed imperviousness remains low.

Construction of the glass domes is based on the properties of earlier tested open-top chambers (OTCs). An air climatisation device together with an adjustable window system, that forms the shell cover of the domes, is able to keep the required [CO2] in both time and spatial scales with the relatively small consumption of supplied CO2. This is achieved by half-closing the windows on the windward side. We evidenced good coupling of treated trees to the atmosphere, including mutual interactions among trees. The semi-open design of the domes moderates the problems of strong wind, humidity, and temperature gradients associated with OTCs. The frequency distributions of the environmental variations within the domes indicate that: air temperature is maintained within the ambient range ±1.0°C for ca. 80 % of the time, and changes in the relative air humidity vary from -15 to 0 % for ca. 82 % of the time. The most important chamber effect is associated with the penetration of solar irradiance, which is reduced by 26 % compared to the open condition outside the domes. The dimensions of the domes are 10 × 10 m in length and 7 m high in the central part. The experiment was done in three identical stands of twelve-year-old Norway spruce trees. The 56 trees are planted at two different spacings to estimate the impacts of stand spatial structure in relation to EC.","Experimental facility; Gas exposure technique; Long-term experiment; Norway spruce; Picea abies","Abies; Picea; Picea abies","Urban, O.; Lab.

This study estimates deforestation from gold mining and analyses the regeneration of abandoned mining areas in the Suriname Amazon. Fieldwork in December 1998 included observations and ecological measurements, as well as qualitative interviews with local miners about mining history and technology. Vegetation cover of abandoned mining sites of different ages was compared with that in old-growth forest. By present estimates, gold miners clear 48-96 km2 of old-growth forest in Suriname annually. Based on different assumptions about changes in technology and the amount of mining that takes place on previously mined sites, cumulative deforestation is expected to reach 750-2280 km2 by 2010. Furthermore, the analysis of abandoned mining sites suggests that forest recovery following mining is slow and qualitatively inferior compared to regeneration following other land uses. Unlike areas in nearby old-growth forest, large parts of mined areas remain bare ground, grass, and standing water. The area deforested by mining may seem relatively small, but given the slow forest recovery and the concentration of mining in selected areas, small-scale gold mining is expected to reduce local forest cover and ecosystem services in regions where mining takes place.","Amazon; Deforestation; Land use/land cover change; Regeneration; Small-scale gold mining; Suriname","Deforestation; Ecosystems; Miners; Vegetation; Forest regeneration; Gold mines; deforestation; ecosystem resilience; gold mine; mining; nature-society relations; regeneration; article; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; land use; mining; Suriname; Suriname","Peterson, G.D.; Center for Limnology, University of Wisconsin, Department of Rural Sociology, Madison, WI 53706, United States; email: gdpeterson@facstaff.wisc.edu",,,03768929,,EVCNA,,"English","Environ.

This paper analyses the consequences of such trade interventions, emphasising the effects on logging behaviour and the allocation of land between forestry and alternative activities (e.g. agriculture). Tropical forestry is modelled as the mining of a heterogeneous, non-renewable resource. Two different harvesting procedures - sequential and simultaneous harvest, are examined. The analysis suggests that logging will be reduced if timber trade restrictions reduce the log price equally for all tree qualities. But if the price reduction is non-uniform, logging may increase in some fields. In fact, total logging may increase as well. It is also shown that timber trade restrictions do not necessarily promote the conversion of forestland to alternative uses. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

To reveal stormflow generating areas and flow paths, hydrometric behaviour of throughfall, soil water from various depths, runoff, and respective concentrations of the environmental tracers 18O, Si, K, SO4 and dissolved organic carbon were monitored for a 14-week period in a steep headwater catchment in the Black Forest Mountains, Germany. Two stormflow hydrographs were selected and, based on 18O and Si, chemically separated into three flow components. Their sources were defined using mixing diagrams. Additional information about stormflow generating mechanisms was derived from recession analyses of the basin's complete 5-year hydrograph record. By providing insight into storage properties and residence times of outflowing reservoirs of the basin, recession analysis proved to be a valuable tool in runoff model conceptualization. Its results agreed well with hydrometric and hydrochemical data. Supported by evaluation of 30 hillslope soil profiles a coherent concept of stormflow generation could be derived: whereas in many steeply sloped basins in the temperature region soil water from hillslopes appears to have an immediate effect on the shape of the stormflow hydrograph, its role at this basin is basically restricted to the recharge of the groundwater reservoir in the near-channel area. Storm hydrograph peaks appear to be derived from a small direct runoff component supplemented by a fast delivery of baseflow from the groundwater reservoir in the valley bottom.

Site characteristics such as physiography, soil moisture, and soil depth; stand characteristics like density and canopy roughness; and tree characteristics such as size, species, rooting depth, and wood strength, are the factors most recognized as influencing damage patterns. The consequences of wind damage to forests, such as change in environmental conditions, density, size structure, species composition, and successional status, occur on both immediate (hours-to-days) and long-term (months-to-decades) time scales. Most wind disturbances result in the post-disturbance vegetation being comprised of surviving canopy trees, and varying amounts of sprouts, released understory stems, and new seedlings. Stand size structure is usually reduced, and successional status of a forest is often advanced. Diversity can be either increased or decreased, depending on the measure of abundance used to calculate diversity. Because tornadoes and downbursts are in part products of thermodynamic climatic circumstances, they may be affected by anticipated changes in climatic conditions as the 21st century progresses. However, the current understanding of tornado and downburst formation from supercell storms is very incomplete, and climate-change model predictions sufficiently coarse, that predictions of changes in frequency, size, intensity, or timing of these extreme events must be regarded as highly uncertain. Moreover, retrospective approaches that employ tree demography and dendrochronology require prohibitively large sample sizes to resolve details of the relationship between climate fluctuations and characteristics of these storms. To improve predictions of changes in the climatology of these storms, we need improved understanding of the genesis of tornadoes and downbursts within thunderstorms, and greater resolution in global climate models. To improve coping strategies, forest scientists can contribute by giving more attention to how various silvicultural actions influence stand and tree vulnerability. Finally, increased focus on the dynamics of forest recovery and regrowth may suggest management actions that can facilitate desired objectives after one of these unpredictable wind disturbances.

Prior to the first sample collection in July, a forest fire burned 2930 ha of mixed conifer and ponderosa pine in the watershed of Caballo Reservoir in south-central New Mexico. The fire was eventually extinguished by summer rains and storm runoff resulting in the mobilization and transport of charred vegetative material into an intermittent tributary (Palomas Creek) that drains the watershed into Caballo Reservoir. Concentrations of total mercury (THg), monomethlymercury (MMHg), and total organic carbon (TOC) in surficial sediments revealed fire, followed by storm runoff, enhanced the transport of mercury and organic matter to the reservoir. Concentrations of THg in sediments increased from 7.5 ηg/g in July to 46.1 ηg/g by November 1995 at one site (Palomas) nearest the outflow of Palomas Creek. No other spatial or temporal trends were observed for THg at other sites throughout the remainder of the study. Concentrations of MMHg in sediments at the Palomas site increased from 0.428 ηg/g in July to 12.46 ηg/g by October 1995 compared to concentrations in sediments at the remaining sites which ranged from 0.11 to 1.50 ηg/g throughout the study. The ratio of MMHg to THg (a gross index of methylation activity) was greatest in sediments from the Palomas site (5.4-33.8%) compared to the remaining sites (0.01-3.60%). The ratio was mirrored by elevated TOC in sediments at the Palomas site (2.5- 11.8%) that remained elevated throughout the study. Fire and subsequent late- summer rains may have had a twofold effect on mercury concentrations in Caballo Reservoir. The storm-driven runoff following the forest fire carried mercury complexed to organic matter which resulted in elevated levels of mercury as well as providing a carbon source for microbial methylation processes in sediment.

The model has been adapted for the two species using estimates of maximum resistive bending moment from historical tree winching studies performed in the two regions, drag coefficients obtained from wind tunnel tests, and wind data from representative meteorological stations. The risk is calculated as the probability that the threshold wind speed for damage will be exceeded at a particular site. This approach enables the effect of different growth rates, soil types, management regimes and wind climates to be investigated. The threshold wind speed for tree failure was calculated for stands of both species grown under standard regimes on typical soils and characteristic topography. The probability that the threshold wind speed is exceeded was determined using a recurrence function fitted to time-series of annual maximum hourly wind speeds from a representative long-term meteorological station for each region. The two species are grown over substantially different rotation lengths, so comparisons were made between the profile of risk over a single rotation, and also as cumulative risk over a time-span sufficient to contain multiple rotations. The results demonstrate substantial differences in the probability of wind damage between forests in the two regions as they are currently managed. Contrary to expectation, the risk is lowest for forests in the region of the most severe wind climate, because of the selection of a risk-minimising strategy. This finding emphasises the degree to which management of forests can affect the frequency and amount of damage that they experience. The model was portable and provided objective estimates of risk for two very different locations and silvicultural regimes. Further development should provide a tool of practical importance for those seeking to make comparisons between very different situations, such as multi-national companies and re-insurers.

Three sets of analyses were conducted: mapping of historical windthrow disturbance patches in the 265-km2 Bull Run basin over the past century and analysis of their relationships with meteorological conditions, landforms, and vegetation; comparison of forest structure and species composition as a function of mapped windthrow and wildfire disturbance history in 34 1-ha vegetation survey plots in Bull Run; and canonical correspondence analysis of environmental factors and forest overstory species composition in 1637 vegetation plots in the Mount Hood and Willamette National Forests. Nearly 10% of the Bull Run basin has been affected by windthrow since 1890, but only 2% was affected prior to the onset of forest harvest in 1958. Most of the mapped windthrow occurred in areas with 500- to 700-yr-old canopy dominants and no mapped disturbance by fire in the past 500 yr. Most mapped windthrow occurred during three events in 1931, 1973, and 1983 that were characterized by extreme high speed east winds from the Columbia River Gorge. Forest harvest modified the effects of climate, landforms, and vegetation on windthrow disturbance, reducing the importance of topographic exposure to east and northeast winds, and creating a strong influence of recent clearcut edges, which accounted for 80% of windthrow in the 1983 event. Shade-tolerant overstory species (western hemlock and Pacific silver fir) are abundant in present-day forest stands affected by windthrow as well as by fire in the past century. In the western Cascade Range, Douglas-fir and western hemlock decline and Pacific silver fir increases with elevation (summer moisture stress declines but temperature variability increases), but this transition occurs at lower elevations in the Bull Run, perhaps because of the interaction between regional climate processes and disturbance along the Columbia Gorge. Complex landscape dynamics result from these contingent interactions among climate, landform and stand conditions, and disturbance.","Canonical correspondence analysis; Clearcut edges; Disturbance history; Douglas-fir; Forest structure; Landscape dynamics; Logistic regression; Oregon, northwest; Pacific silver fir; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Tsuga heterophylla; Western hemlock; Windthrow disturbance","community structure; disturbance; environmental factor; forest dynamics; stand structure; windthrow; Bull Run Basin; Oregon; United States; Abies; Abies amabilis; Abies amabilis; Conium; Conium maculatum; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Tsuga; Tsuga heterophylla; Tsuga heterophylla","Sinton, D.S.; Division of Environmental Studies, Alfred University, Alfred, NY 14802, United States; email: dsinton@alfred.edu",,"Ecological Society of America",00129658,,ECOLA,,"English","Ecology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033862157

In Sweden, approximately 4 million m3 are damaged annually by snow and wind, roughly corresponding to a value of US$150 million, and in Europe, the damage amounts to hundreds of millions of US dollars each year. To help to reduce these losses; tools for risk assessment within forest management have been developed. Predictions were developed of the risk of damage from snow and wind to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] and Birch (Betula spp. L.) plots using tree, stand, and site characteristics. The data were obtained from 6756 permanent sample plots within the Swedish National Forest Inventory, which were inventoried twice at five-year intervals between 1983 and 1992. Input data for model development used measurements from the first inventory of tree characteristics for the largest sample tree, stand, and site data, and records of snow and wind damage from the second inventory. Models were developed for three different regions for pine- and spruce-dominated sites, while models for the whole country were developed for birch sites. In general the estimated proportion of damaged plots was highly overestimated (31.7%56.2%), compared with the observed proportion of 3.4%11.9%. The models for Norway spruce comprising tree, stand, and site data show the best predictability of damaged plots, with 60.6%-67.6% of plots correctly classified. It is concluded that the models developed can be used to detect sites with a high probability of damage from snow and wind, and thus be used as tools to reduce future damage and costs in practical forestry.","Birch; Norway spruce; Risk assessment; Risk management; Scots pine; Silviculture","Birch trees; Pine trees; Spruce; Data reduction; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Forestry; Mathematical models; Risk assessment; Snow; Vegetation; Wind effects; Environmental engineering; snow; forest management; modeling; risk assessment; snow; wind; article; model; nonhuman; pine; risk assessment; risk management; Sweden; tree; wind; Sweden; Abies; Betula; Picea; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris","Valinger, E.; Faculty of Forestry, Department of Silviculture, Swedish Univ. of Agricultural Sci., S-901 83 Umea, Sweden",,,0364152X,,EMNGD,,"English","Environ.

We designed an experiment, based on a simulated hurricane blowdown, to examine the relationship of tree damage patterns to mortality and regeneration, community dynamics, vegetation recovery, and ecosystem processes. In October 1990, selected canopy trees in a 50 x 160 m area within a 75-yr-old Quercus rubra-Acer rubrum forest in central Massachusetts were pulled over by a winch, using records from the 1938 hurricane to determine the number of trees and direction of fall. The resulting damage to 65% of trees closely approximated effects of the 1938 storm on New England forests. Damage and mortality varied by tree species and size, indicating the importance of pre-disturbance forest structure and composition in determining the range and severity of impact. Measurements of vegetation and environment in the experimental area and control indicated that, although the manipulated stand sustained dramatic damage and structural reorganization, resilience of trees and understory vegetation provided tight biotic control of ecosystem processes, including nutrient cycling. Continued leaf-out and induced sprouting by damaged trees, increased growth by saplings and understory plants, and seedling establishment on disturbed microsites stabilized the microenvironment. Our findings are in contrast to studies of disturbances in which mortality was higher when damaged trees were removed from the site. This suggests that salvage logging following wind disturbance may have serious long-term implications.","Blowdown, simulated; Forest composition and structure; Forest dynamics, long term; Hurricanes; New England; Regeneration; Salvage logging; Temperate forests; Wind disturbance","ecosystem; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem response; environmental disturbance; hurricane","Foster, D.R.; Harvard Forest, Harvard University, P.O.

During 1994, two ice storms struck southwestern Virginia within a three-week period. Heavy ice deposition occurred during each storm when warm, moist air was advected over a shallow subfreezing layer at the surface. Cold-air damming helped trap the cold surface air, as is typical for ice storms in parts of the Appalachians and Piedmont. Heaviest forest damage occurred on mountain slopes facing south and east. Ice damage in these topographic positions removed approximately 30% to 60% of total basal area and created large canopy openings.

Box 24, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","The characteristics of microhabitats of established Pinus sylvestris and Betula seedlings were studied in a small windthrow gap in a mature P. sylvestris-dominated forest in the Petkeljarvi National Park in eastern Finland. Seedlings were strongly clustered in disturbed microhabitats, particularly uprooting pits and mounds, formed by tree falls. They covered 3% of the 0.3.ha study area consisting of the gap and some of the forest edge. Although Betula occurred only as scattered individuals in the dominant canopy layer of the forest, it accounted for 30% of the seedlings found in the study area. Betula regeneration was almost completely restricted to pits and mounds, where 91% of the seedlings were found. Uprooting spots were also the most important regeneration microhabitats for Pinus, where 60 % of the seedlings grew, even though the seedlings were found in other substrates as well, particularly on sufficiently decomposed coarse wood. Undisturbed field- and bottom-layer vegetation had effectively hindered tree seedling establishment, which emphasises the role of soil disturbance for regeneration. While the establishment of seedlings was found to be clearly determined by the availability of favourable regeneration microhabitats, the early growth of seedlings was affected by a complex interaction of environmental variables, including the type of microhabitat, radiation environment and interferences caused by competing seedlings and adjacent trees. In the most important regeneration microhabitats, i.e. in uprooting pits and on mounds, the distributions of the local elevations of Pinus and Betula seedlings were different. Pinus seedlings occurred closer to ground level, i.e. on the fringes of pits and lower on mounds, while Betula seedlings grew deeper in pits and higher on mounds. The position of the Betula seedlings indicate that they may have a competitive advantage over Pinus seedlings in the dense seedling groups occurring in uprooting spots. We suggest that this initial difference in Pinus and Betula establishment may affect the subsequent within-gap tree species succession and can, in part, explain the general occurrence of Betula in conifer-dominated boreal forests.","Betula; Competition; Disturbance; Gap regeneration; Heterogeneity; Patch dynamics; Pinus sylvestris; Regeneration niche; Spatial pattern","Betula; Coniferophyta; Pinus sylvestris; Pinus sylvestris","Kuuluvainen, T.; Department of Forest Ecology, University of Helsinki, P.O.

In this study we use chronosequence analysis to examine whether the structure of the ant community varies with the type of disturbance and the time since disturbance. We treat the recovery trajectory after fire as a control trajectory because fire is an endogenous disturbance. The main analyses were based on an ant fauna comprising 72 species sampled from 44 sites surveyed in December 1992. Comparison with samples taken in April and December 1991, and for cumulative records for all sites over this 20 month period, all show quantitatively similar responses. Results suggest that while fire has a minor effect on the composition of the ant community over time, the impact of clearing and mining is much more severe. Ant species richness at cleared and mined sites recovers rapidly, overshoots controls in mid-succession and returns to control levels by 18 years after disturbance. The cumulative number of species recorded over all sites (from the total recorded fauna of 82 species) for each different disturbance type were: burned, 61; cleared, 55; and mined 56. Species composition at cleared or mined sites, after 18 years, approaches but does not match controls. The recovery trend for mined sites lags slightly behind that for cleared sites, which have reached 49% similarity with the oldest burned sites, while mined sites have not exceeded 39% similarity of species composition. The main patterns in the ant community appear to be related to habitat variables. These results provide further evidence that the ant community may be used as a reliable bio-indicator for evaluating the extent of habitat damage and recovery after disturbance in these Australian forests.","Ants; Australia; Burning; Clearing; Disturbance; Forest; Mining; Regeneration; Succession",,"Fox, B.J.; School of Biological Science, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,,14429985,,AUECF,,"English","Austral Ecol.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-17644365836

Wind damage has been quantified in a variety of ways that lead to differing conclusions regarding severity of disturbance. Measuring damage as structural loss (percent stems damaged) and as compositional loss (percent stems dead) is suggested as a standard for quantifying severity. Catastrophic wind produces a range of gaps from the size caused by individual treefalls to much larger areas. The spatial pattern of damage is influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors that influence severity of damage include stem size, species, stand conditions (canopy structure, density), and the presence of pathogens. Abiotic factors that influence severity of damage include the intensity of the wind, previous disturbance, topography, and soil characteristics. Recovery from catastrophic wind disturbance follows one of four paths: regrowth, recruitment, release, or repression. The path of recovery for a given site is controlled both by the severity of disturbance and by environmental gradients of resources. Recovery is influenced also by frequency of wind disturbance, which varies across geographical regions. To develop robust theories regarding catastrophic wind disturbance, the relative roles of different abiotic and biotic factors in controlling the patterns of severity of damage must be determined. These patterns of severity and environmental gradients must then be tied to long-term dynamics of recovery.",,"cyclone; forest damage; forest recovery; hurricane; tornado; wind disturbance","Everham III, E.M.; Box 6938, Radford University, Radford, VA 24142, United States",,"New York Botanical Garden Press",00068101,,BOREA,,"English","Bot.
