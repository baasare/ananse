AB  - [An Internet-based survey was administered to understand whether there were differences in perception among Georgia and Mississippi registered foresters with regard to environmental factors leading to forest damage during strong wind events. The perception among both groups was that recent management activity, forest density, and recent weather activity are the most important factors for pine plantations and natural pine forests. These factors, and soil conditions, were perceived important for upland and bottomland hardwood forests. Significant differences in perception among the two groups were found, particularly with regard to the proximity of forests to openings or wetlands, which may be reflective of different experiences dealing with the consequences of severe storms, or reflective of differences in topography, tree species, or soil conditions between the states. Our study indicates that the level of importance the registered foresters place on factors leading to forest damage may differ from results of site-specific research studies.]

AB  - [Thigmomorphogenesis includes the effects of mechanical perturbation on plant growth. To test whether thigmomorphogenesis is evident at different scales within plants, we investigated the effect of wind on allometric relationships between specific plant parts. We chose two species from the elfin cloud forest of Puerto Rico that have contrasting growth habits, the shrub Clibadiun erosum (Asteraceae) and the palm Prestoea acuminata var. montana (Arecaceae), and subjected them to barrier-protected and wind-exposed treatments. For C. erosum, we compared the allometry of stems and branches against three allometric models that predict that plant height or branch length increases at the 1, 2/3, and 1/2 power of stem diameter. Only the geometric similarity model (scaling exponent of 1) seemed to hold when plants were exposed to the wind. We found relatively fewer leaves per number of branches produced and fewer leaves per increment of branch diameter in the plants of C. erosum exposed to the wind. Mean petiole length ratios (petiole length/basal radius) of P. acuminata were higher on leaves of barrier-protected plants for both simple and compound leaves, indicating that petioles were stouter and mechanically safer in the wind-exposed plants. We suggest that alteration of the allometric relationships of plant parts, organs, or plant modules (stems and branches of erosum and leaves of P. acuminata) and alteration of the number of plant parts (leaves and branches of C. erosum) are adaptive responses resulting from the mechanical perturbation induced by wind in the elfin forest.]

AU  - Edman, Mattias

AB  - [Coarse woody debris (CWD) is a key habitat for many species in forest ecosystems. To ensure the long-term survival of such species, forest management regimes must include measures that promote dead wood dynamics similar to those of natural forests. Thus, information on CWD dynamics under natural conditions is required, including data pertaining to the underlying agents of disturbance. This study examines modes of mortality, decay rates, and temporal patterns in the availability of Picea abies logs in a Swedish old-growth forest affected by internal, small-scale disturbance. All 684 logs in a 6.6-ha plot were mapped and classified into one of six decay classes. Logs in the early stages of decay were examined for the presence of heart-rot fungi. Six years later all logs were re-inventoried, including newly formed logs. Matrix models based on the transition rates between decay classes showed that it took about 60 years for 90% of the logs to decay beyond class 6 (a deformed trunk with soft wood). Large logs (≥26 cm) decayed 40% more slowly than small logs (≤25 cm). The initial volume of logs was 37.6 m³/ha but increased to 44.8 m³/ha after six years. In addition, there was a large shift in the decay-class distribution. The volume of logs in early and late decay classes increased by 71% and 45%, respectively, while the volume of logs in the intermediate decay classes decreased by 32%. The fluctuations appear to result from pulses in mortality, driven by a combination of strong winds and the heart-rot fungus, Phellinus chrysoloma, which was present in more than 30% of all logs at an early stage of decay. These results show that large temporal fluctuations in dead wood also occur in the absence of large-scale disturbance, and that heart-rot fungi are important factors driving the overall dynamics of dead wood. Since many wood-inhabiting species are naturally rare and have very specific substrate demands, such temporal variability in dead wood availability may have effects on biodiversity and should be taken into account when designing small, protected forest areas.]

TI  - Wind-throw Mortality in the Southern Boreal Forest: Effects of Species, Diameter and Stand Age

AB  - [1. Patterns of tree mortality as influenced by species, diameter and stand age were assessed across a gradient in wind disturbance intensity in a southern boreal forest in Minnesota, USA. Few previous studies have addressed how wind impacts boreal forests where fire was historically the dominant type of disturbance. 2. We surveyed 29 334 trees of nine species within a 236 000 ha blowdown in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), in forests that have never been logged and were not salvaged after the windstorm. Within the disturbed area, a range of disturbance severity from zero to complete canopy mortality was present, overlaying an existing mosaic of fire origin stands. For this study, we derived an index of wind disturbance intensity by standardizing the observed disturbance severity using common species with similar diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) distributions. We then used multiple logistic regression to assess patterns of tree mortality across gradients in tree size and wind intensity index, and for three stand ages. 3. Probability of mortality was higher with increasing In d.b.h. for all nine species, with two species (Abies balsamea and Picea mariana) showing much more dramatic shifts in mortality with d.b.h. than the others. As hypothesized, the species most susceptible to windthrow at all d.b.h. classes were early successional and shade intolerant (Pinus banksiana, Pinus resinosa, Populus tremuloides) and those least susceptible were generally shade tolerant (e.g. Thuja occidentalis, Acer rubrum), although the intolerant species Betula papyrifera also had low mortality. 4. Mortality rates were higher in mature (c. 90 years old) stands than for old and very old (c. 126-200 years old) stands, probably because old stands had already gone through transition to a multi-aged stage of development. 5. Synthesis. Quantification of canopy mortality patterns generally supports disturbance-mediated accelerated succession following wind disturbance in the southern boreal forest. This wind-induced weeding of the forest favoured Thuja occidentalis, Betula papyrifera and Acer rubrum trees of all sizes, along with small Abies balsamea and Picea mariana trees. Overall, the net impact of wind disturbance must concurrently consider species mortality probability, abundance and diameter distributions.]

AU  - Vowels, Kelly M.
AB  - [Ice storms are one of the main causes of disturbance and mortality in oak forests and can occur more frequently than wind storms, fire, diseases, and insect outbreaks. The effects of the 2009 ice storm on the tree species were studied in an upland oak-hickory forest at Bernheim Forest, Kentucky. Approximately 14% of the trees showed some damage from the ice storm with Ostrya virginiana, Acer rubrum, and Quercus rubra being most susceptible to damage. Quercus velutina, Quercus alba, and Sassafras albidium were least Pole size trees were more vulnerable to damage than sapling and sawtimber. Trees found in the midstory, and on the eastern slope had more damage from the ice storm than the other trees. Immediately following the ice storm, seedlings showed a high mortality, and it took until 2011 before most species returned to pre ice storm levels. Seedling numbers did not return to pre ice storm levels on the ridgetop and western upper slopes, which are more vulnerable to drought. By damaging the A. rubrum more than the Quercus and Carya species, and opening the understory, the ice storm is reducing midstory canopy and may be changing the composition of upland oak forests.]

TI  - Species Resistance and Community Response to Wind Disturbance Regimes in Northern Temperate Forests
AU  - Papaik, M. J.
AU  - Canham, C. D.
AB  - [1 Severe winds are the predominant cause of natural disturbance in temperate forests of north-eastern and north-central North America. Conceptual models of the effects of wind disturbance have traditionally focused on the impacts of catastrophic disturbances and have painted a simple picture of how disturbance acts to maintain tree species diversity. These models ignore variation among species characteristics that could have important consequences for both resistance to and recovery from disturbance. 2 We integrated an empirically parameterized, mechanistic model of windstorm mortality (WINDSTORM) and a seed-mass-based dispersal and recruitment model into a spatially explicit, individual tree model of forest dynamics (SORTIE) in order to create simulated long-term 'experiments' designed to explore the sensitivity of forest composition and structure to species-specific resistance to and recovery from disturbance. 3 We found that species-specific variation in resistance to wind mortality interacted strongly with: (i) shade tolerance characteristics, (ii) the medium-term history of disturbances, (iii) the long-term average severity of the disturbance regime and (iv) seedbed substrate dynamics to influence tree population dynamics and successional trajectories. 4 We also examined how local and long-distance dispersal affect response to wind disturbance. Ignoring differences among local dispersal characteristics overestimates the importance of dispersal-limited species. Our results show that long-distance immigration maintains species coexistence only if the immigration rate is very high relative to local dispersal. Despite this, stand-scale models that ignore long-distance dispersal can underestimate population dynamics of dispersal-limited species. 5 Our results indicate that landscape-scale heterogeneity in structure and species composition in these forests is facilitated by synergisms between the stochastic nature of wind disturbance and complex interactions between species traits that govern: (i) resistance to disturbance, (ii) local dispersal and seedling establishment and (iii) competitive (i.e. growth/survival) traits that do not adhere to strict tradeoffs. 6 We conclude that wind disturbance has much more complex and variable effects on long-term dynamics of forest structure and composition than suggested by previous models. In particular, non-catastrophic disturbances can generate important variation in forest dynamics that can either lead to dominance by a single or small number of species, or facilitate species coexistence.]

AB  - [Question: Have past windstorm events influenced the structure and composition of mountain forests in the Tatra Mountains? Can severe and infrequent wind disturbances lead to dynamic coexistence of two tree species with different ecological requirements? Location: Subalpine mixed spruce-larch forest at 1200-1300 m a.s.l. in the Slovakian Tatra Mountains. A forested site affected by catastrophic large-scale windthrow on 19 November 2004. Methods: Sixty-seven spruce and 30 larch cross-sections from the oldest cohorts were collected in a regular pattern in a 100-ha plot. Tree-ring series were analysed to reconstruct growth releases associated with past windthrows. A boundary-line release criterion was applied to detect disturbance year. Spatial patterns of release signals were statistically detected with Mantel's test. We compared reconstructed years of disturbance events with historical records. Results: Releases in both species showed three main pulses. More than 85% showed major or moderate releases in 1865-1879, 48% in 1915-1924, and 25% in 1940-1949. All of these disturbance events affected the whole 100-ha area. Releases were spatially patterned in the first disturbances, but distributed randomly in the last. Releases co-occurred in time with enhanced production of compression wood, suggesting disturbances were of wind origin. Reconstructed dates of windthrows were confirmed using historical data on storms. Conclusions: At least three windthrows of major and moderate severity took place in the last 150 years on southern slopes of the Tatra Mountains. This disturbance regime may contribute to coexistence of spruce and larch through differences in vulnerability and response to heavy windstorms.]

However, little is known about the effects of wind farms on the ecology of tropical landbirds. In this study, we evaluated changes in bird-community diversity, composition, and structure directly beneath wind turbines, 200 m away from turbines, and in nearby croplands and secondary forests. In general, our results show (1) a gradient of species richness, with values highest in croplands and secondary forests, intermediate values 200 m from turbines, and lowest values beneath turbines, (2) fairly similar bird abundance for all treatments, with values highest in secondary forests in autumn and lowest 200 m from turbines in autumn, (3) bird communities highly similar at each season, but communities at 0 and 200 m from turbines differed strongly in autumn and communities at the rest of the studied sites differed strongly during both spring and autumn, (4) evenness of the bird community greater in secondary forests and croplands and lower at both distances from wind turbines, and (5) the area covered by croplands outside the wind farm played an important role, often related to increases in species richness. Our results also suggest that wind farms have a greater effect on wintering migrants than on residents; however, further studies are required for such a comparison to be tested robustly.]

AB  - [The Wind River old-growth forest, in the southern Cascade Range of Washington State, is a cool (average annual temperature, 8.7°C), moist (average annual precipitation, 2223 mm), 500-year-old Douglas-fir-western hemlock forest of moderate to low productivity at 371-m elevation on a less than 10% slope. There is a seasonal snowpack (November-March), and rain-on-snow and freezing-rain events are common in winter. Local geology is characterized by volcanic rocks and deposits of Micocene/Oligocene Micocene-Oligocene (mixed) Micocene and Quaternary age, as well as intrusive rocks of Miocene age. Soils are medial, mesic, Entic Vitrands that are deep (2-3 m), well drained, loams and silt loams, generally stone free, and derived from volcanic tephra. The vegetation is transitional, between the Western Hemlock Zone and the Pacific Silver Fir Zone, and the understory is dominated by vine maple, salal, and Oregon grape. Stand structural parameters have been measured on a 4-ha plot. There are eight species of conifers, with a stand density of $427\ \text{trees}\ {\rm ha}^{-1}$ and basal area of $82.9\ {\rm m}^{2}\ {\rm ha}^{-1}$. Dominant conifers include Douglas-fir $(35\ \text{trees}\ {\rm ha}^{-1})$, western hemlock $(224\ \text{trees}\ {\rm ha}^{-1})$, Pacific yew $(86\ \text{trees}\ {\rm ha}^{-1})$, western red cedar $(30\ \text{trees}\ {\rm ha}^{-1})$, and Pacific silver fir $(47\ \text{trees}\ {\rm ha}^{-1})$. The average height of Douglas-fir is 52.0 m (tallest tree, 64.6 m), whereas western hemlock averages 19.0 m (tallest tree, 55.7 m). The regional disturbance regime is dominated by high-severity to moderate-severity fire, from which this forest is thought to have originated. There is no evidence that fire has occurred in the forest after establishment. Primary agents of stand disturbance, which act at the individual to small groups of trees scale, are wind, snow loads, and drought, in combination and interacting with root-rot and butt-rot fungi, heart-rot fungi, dwarf mistletoe, and bark beetles. The forest composition is slowly shifting from dominance by Douglas-fir, a shade-intolerant species, to western hemlock, western red cedar, Pacific yew, and Pacific silver fir, all shade-tolerant species. The Wind River old-growth forest fits the regional definition of Douglas-fir "old growth" on western hemlock sites.]

AU  - Rentch, James S.
AB  - [This study examined the relationship between direction of treefall, slope-aspect and prevailing wind in five old-growth stands where single-tree canopy gaps characterize the dominant disturbance regime. All live and downed trees were inventoried in 0.45-ha sample plots, and crown sizes of live trees were measured along two perpendicular axes. Directions of fall and slope-aspect of downed trees also were recorded. Regional prevailing winds and wind gusts were obtained from four nearby airports. I used circular statistics to determine if directions of treefall for each study stand had a mean direction or if the directions of fall were uniformly distributed. If directions of treefall had a true mean, they were then compared to mean slope aspect and prevailing wind directions. At two of eight plots, treefall directions were uniformly distributed (i.e., no mean direction). Only one plot showed a statistically significant similarity between mean slope-aspect and mean direction of fall, and only three of the eight study plots showed statistically significant similarities between mean treefall and wind directions. Mean crown asymmetry (ratio of long and short diameters) was 1.26, and there were no significant differences in asymmetry values when current gap border trees and non border trees were compared. While trees may fall downhill and downwind, the high variation in treefall and wind directions precluded establishing a consistent statistical relationship between these data sets. I suggest that crown asymmetry, resulting from differential crown growth of trees on sloped-hillsides and within canopy gaps, exerts a strong additional influence on direction of fall.]

AB  - [Didymopanax pittieri is a common shadeintolerant tree colonizing treefall gaps in the elfin forests on windswept ridgecrests in the lower montane rain forests of the Cordillera de Tilaran, Costa Rica. All D. pittieri taller than > 0.5 m in a 5.2-ha elfin forested portion of a gridded study watershed in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve were located, mapped, and measured. This local population of D. pittieri is spatially inhomogeneous, in that density increases with increasing wind exposure; D. pittieri are more abundant near ridge crests than lower on windward slopes. The important and ubiquitous phenomenon of spatial inhomogeneity in population density is addressed and corrected for in spatial analyses by the application of the inhomogeneous version of Ripley's K. The spatial patterns of four size classes of D. pittieri (< 5 cm dbh, 5-10 cm dbh, 10-20 cm dbh, and > 20 cm dbh) were investigated. Within the large-scale trend in density driven by wind exposure, D. pittieri saplings are clumped at the scale of treefall gaps and at the scale of patches of aggregated gaps. D. pittieri 5-10 cm dbh are randomly distributed, apparently due to competitive thinning of sapling clumps during the early stages of gap-phase regeneration. D. pittieri larger than 10 cm dbh are overdispersed at a scale larger than that of patches of gaps. Natural disturbance can influence the distribution of shade intolerant tree populations at several different spatial scales, and can have discordant effects at different life history stages.]

TI  - Forest Damage and Recovery from Catastrophic Wind
AU  - Edwin M. Everham, III
AU  - Nicholas V. L. Brokaw
AB  - [The literature on the effects of catastrophic wind disturbance (windstorms, gales, cyclones, hurricanes, tornadoes) on forest vegetation is reviewed to examine factors controlling the severity of damage and the dynamics of recovery. Wind damage has been quantified in a variety of ways that lead to differing conclusions regarding severity of disturbance. Measuring damage as structural loss (percent stems damaged) and as compositional loss (percent stems dead) is suggested as a standard for quantifying severity. Catastrophic wind produces a range of gaps from the size caused by individual treefalls to much larger areas. The spatial pattern of damage is influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors that influence severity of damage include stem size, species, stand conditions (canopy structure, density), and the presence of pathogens. Abiotic factors that influence severity of damage include the intensity of the wind, previous disturbance, topography, and soil characteristics. Recovery from catastrophic wind disturbance follows one of four paths: regrowth, recruitment, release, or repression. The path of recovery for a given site is controlled both by the severity of disturbance and by environmental gradients of resources. Recovery is influenced also by frequency of wind disturbance, which varies across geographical regions. To develop robust theories regarding catastrophic wind disturbance, the relative roles of different abiotic and biotic factors in controlling the patterns of severity of damage must be determined. These patterns of severity and environmental gradients must then be tied to long-term dynamics of recovery. /// La literatura sobre los efectos de disturbios catastróficos del viento (tormentas, ventarrones, ciclones, huracánes, tornados) sobre la vegetación de bosque es revisada para examinar los factores que controlan la severidad del daño y la dinámica de recuperación. El daño del viento puede ser cuantificado en varias formas, lo cual conlleva a diferir en las conclusiones en cuanto a la severidad del disturbio. Medir daños como la pérdida estructural (por ciento de tallos dañados) y la pérdida composicional (porcentaje de tallos muertos) son normas sugeridas para cuantificar la severidad. Los vientos catastróficos producen una extensión de aperturas de gran tamaño causados por árboles caídos sobre muchas otras áreas mayores. El patrón espacial de daño es influenciado por factores abióticos y bióticos. Factores bióticos que influyen severamente al daño pueden ser tamaño del tallo, especie, condición de tolerancia (estructura del dosel, densidad), y la presencia de patogénos. Factores abióticos que influyen severamente sobre el daño incluyen la intensidad del viento, disturbios anteriores, topografía, y las características del suelo. La recuperación de las catástrofes causados por el viento siguen uno de cuatro patrones: crecimiento, reclutaje, liberar o reprimir. La trayectoria de recuperación para un lugar es controlado por ambos: por lo severo del disturbio y por los gradientes ambientales del recurso. La recuperación es influenciada también por la frecuencia del disturbio por viento, el cual varia sobre el globo. Para desarrollar una fuerte teoría en cuanto a disturbios catastróficos por viento, los roles relativos de los factores abióticos y bióticos en el control de modelos de severidad de daño tienen que ser determinados. Estos modelos de severidad y gradientes ambientales tienen que ser enlazados para una dinámica de recobro a largo plazo. /// Обзор литературы о воздействии катастрофических ветров (штормов, циклонов, ураганов, смерчей) на лесную растительность с целью выявления факторов, влияющих на величину ущерба и на динамику рекомпенсации. Ущерб от ветра оценивается различными методами, приводящими к разным выбодам. Измерение ущерба как структурного воздействия (процент поврежденных стволов) и как композиционного воздействия (процент погибших стволов) предложено в качестве стандарта. Катастрофический ветер образует серию проплешин, размер которых колеблется в широком диапазоне. Пространственная конфигурация ущерба находится под воздействием как биотических, так и абиотических факторов. Биотические факторы величины ущерба включают: размер ствола, особенности особи, условия древостоя (структура и плотность листвы) и присутствие патогенов. Абиотические факторы величины ущерба включают интенсивность ветра, предшествующие атмосферные возмущения, топографию и характеристики почвы. Рекомпенсация после катастрофического ветрового воздействия следует по одному из четырех путей: спонтанное возобновление, спонтанное замещение дпугими древесными особями, подавление нижних ярусов древостоя (нуждающееся в их "высвобождении" от листвы верхнего яруса), нашествие сорняковой растительности. Какой из путей рекомпенсации возобладает, зависит от масштаба атмосферного возмущения и от целого ряда средовых градиентов. Рекомпенсация также зависит от глобально изменчивой частоты ветровых возмущений. Для создания продуктивных теорий измерения ветрового ущерба необходима оценка различных биотических и абиотических факторов, влияющих на величину и конфигурацию ущерба. Последняя, а также средовые градиенты должны быть увязаны с долгосрочной динамикой рекомпенсации.]

TI  - Successional Replacement Mediated by Frequency and Severity of Wind and Snow Disturbances in a Picea-Abies Forest
AU  - Nishimura, Takashi B.
AB  - [Question: How do wind and snow disturbances affect the successional replacement of Picea glehnii by Abies sachalinensis in a subalpine coniferous forest? Location: Cool temperate, northern Japan. Methods: Tree demography (growth, mortality and recruitment rates) was determined by repeated measurements of stem diameter and height, and multiple censuses in four Picea-Abies stands undergoing succession. Above-ground stand biomass, residence time and tree growth trajectories of the component species were estimated to examine successional changes in structure and dynamics. Individual based simulations were used to examine the effects of disturbances that slowed down succession. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine the relative importance of disturbance frequency and intensity on species composition during succession. Results: Above-ground biomass was larger in P. glehnii than in A. sachalinensis stands, whereas residence time, a proxy of productivity, was much shorter for A. sachalinensis than for P. glehnii populations. During successional replacement, both species increased in initial growth rate and decreased in size-dependency of growth in canopy gaps. These plastic growth responses were more prominent in P. glehnii than in A. sachalinensis. Disturbance frequency was the most important predictor of species composition in the simulations, and windstorms were more important than snowfall in terms of disturbance intensity. Conclusions: The frequency of natural disturbances does not have the potential to initiate stand dynamics but it does, however, slow down succession. When disturbance is locally frequent because of the direction and pitch of the topography, early-successional P. glehnii stands may persist for thousands of years.]

TI  - Forest Structure and Light Regimes Following Moderate Wind Storms: Implications for Multi-Cohort Management
AU  - Hanson, Jacob J.
AU  - Lorimer, Craig G.
AB  - [Moderate-severity disturbances appear to be common throughout much of North America, but they have received relatively little detailed study compared to catastrophic disturbances and small gap dynamics. In this study, we examined the immediate impact of moderate-intensity wind storms on stand structure, opening sizes, and light regimes in three hemlock-hardwood forests of northeastern Wisconsin. These were compared to three stands managed by single-tree and group selection, the predominant forest management system for northern hardwoods in the region. Wind storms removed an average of 41% of the stand basal area, compared to 27% removed by uneven-aged harvests, but both disturbances removed trees from a wide range of size classes. The removal of nearly half of the large trees by wind in two old-growth stands caused partial retrogression to mature forest structure, which has been hypothesized to be a major disturbance pathway in the region. Wind storms resulted in residual stand conditions that were much more heterogeneous than in managed stands. Gap sizes ranged from less than 10 m² up to 5000 m² in wind-disturbed stands, whereas the largest opening observed in managed stands was only 200 m² . Wind-disturbed stands had, on average, double the available solar radiation at the forest floor compared to managed stands. Solar radiation levels were also more heterogeneous in wind-disturbed stands, with six times more variability at small scales (0.1225 ha) and 15 times more variability at the whole-stand level. Modification of uneven-aged management regimes to include occasional harvests of variable intensity and spatial pattern may help avoid the decline in species diversity that tends to occur after many decades of conventional uneven-aged management. At the same time, a multi-cohort system with these properties would retain a high degree of average crown cover, promote structural heterogeneity typical of old-growth forests, and maintain dominance by late-successional species.]

AB  - [We elucidate spatial controls of wind and fire disturbance across northern Wisconsin (USA), where climatic and topographic gradients are not strong, using data from the original US Public Land Survey (PLS) notes. These records contain information on the location and extent of heavy windthrows and stand-replacing fires prior to Euro-American settlement. The spatial patterns of windthrow and fire were spatially clustered at all scales in this historical environment, with stronger associations at local than regional scales. Logistic regression shows environmental variables to have a strong influence on this pattern. In the case of heavy windthrow, environmental drivers of disturbance pattern are fairly consistent across the region. The effects of climate and vegetation are predominant at all scales, but effects are often indirect, with strong interactions between them. Interactions between these two drivers and soil characteristics are also sometimes present. In contrast, models of stand-replacing fire show simple and direct control within and across fire-prone landscapes of historical northern Wisconsin, with climate and physiography as the main factors explaining the distribution of fire disturbance. This simple and direct control is lost at the regional scale, where climate, physiographic, soil, and vegetation variables, along with interactions between them, are significant factors. Contrary to other regions, the topographic effects are generally not important in predicting either wind or fire disturbance. Our work suggests that, in landscapes that lack strong environmental patterning, climate maintains its role as a primary driver of these natural disturbances, but topography is replaced by interactions and feedbacks with other forms of environmental heterogeneity.]

AB  - [Infrequent, intense wind disturbance is an important factor in northeastern U.S. forests, yet little is known about the early stages of vegetation reorganization, or the processes that facilitate biotic regulation of ecosystem function after such storms. We designed an experiment, based on a simulated hurricane blowdown, to examine the relationship of tree damage patterns to mortality and regeneration, community dynamics, vegetation recovery, and ecosystem processes. In October 1990, selected canopy trees in a 50 × 160 m area within a 75-yr-old Quercus rubra-Acer rubrum forest in central Massachusetts were pulled over by a winch, using records from the 1938 hurricane to determine the number of trees and direction of fall. The resulting damage to 65% of trees closely approximated effects of the 1938 storm on New England forests. Damage and mortality varied by tree species and size, indicating the importance of pre-disturbance forest structure and composition in determining the range and severity of impact. Measurements of vegetation and environment in the experimental area and control indicated that, although the manipulated stand sustained dramatic damage and structural reorganization, resilience of trees and understory vegetation provided tight biotic control of ecosystem processes, including nutrient cycling. Continued leaf-out and induced sprouting by damaged trees, increased growth by saplings and understory plants, and seedling establishment on disturbed microsites stabilized the microenvironment. Our findings are in contrast to studies of disturbances in which mortality was higher when damaged trees were removed from the site. This suggests that salvage logging following wind disturbance may have serious long-term implications.]

TI  - Severe Wind and Fire Regimes in Northern Forests: Historical Variability at the Regional Scale
AU  - Schulte, Lisa A.
AU  - Mladenoff, David J.
AB  - [Within the northern Great Lakes region, mesoscale (10s to 100s of km2) forest patterning is driven by disturbance dynamics. Using original Public Land Survey (PLS) records in northern Wisconsin, USA, we study spatial patterns of wind and fire disturbances during the pre-Euroamerican settlement period (ca. 1850). Our goals were: (1) to determine how effectively wind and fire disturbance can be reconstructed from the PLS, (2) to assess the roles of wind and fire in shaping vegetation patterns, (3) to evaluate landscape to regional controls of wind and fire regimes, and (4) to assess the potential for interactions between these disturbances. Our analyses indicate that only relatively intense fire and wind disturbance can be reliably detected from the PLS (62-68% canopy removal). Heavy windthrow was more prevalent than fire disturbance in presettlement forests, and wind-disturbed patches were comparatively smaller and more complex in shape. Disturbance rotation periods ranged between 450 and 10 500 years for heavy windthrow and between 700 and 93 000 years for stand-replacing fire. Occurrences of wind and fire disturbance were related to geographic province and to regional soil patterns; analysis further suggests a negative interaction between the two disturbance types. Given that severe wind disturbance was infrequent, mature to old forests of late-successional species dominated much of pre-Euroamerican northern Wisconsin, but wind disturbances may have allowed regional persistence of less shade-tolerant species, such as Betula alleghaniensis. Pine-dominated vegetation was limited to regions with more frequent fire, but frequencies of stand-replacing fire derived from survey records were insufficient to maintain these successional vegetation types; we suggest that frequent surface fires, not recorded in the PLS, along with infrequent stand-replacing fire, maintained these vegetation types. The extensive nature of the PLS provides a powerful baseline for addressing changes in forest conditions and disturbance regimes associated with climate and land use for both the present and more distant past. Such baselines are informative in discussions of historical variability and restoration silviculture.]

TI  - Foliage Shedding in Deciduous Forests Lifts up Long-Distance Seed Dispersal by Wind
AU  - Nathan, Ran
AU  - Katul, Gabriel G.
AU  - Terborgh, John
AB  - Seed terminal velocity and release height are recognized as key biotic determinants of long-distance dispersal (LDD) of seeds by wind. Yet, potential determinants at the ecosystem level, such as seasonal dynamics in foliage density characterizing many deciduous forests, have received much less attention. We integrated detailed field observations and experiments with a mechanistic wind dispersal model to assess how seasonal variation in foliage density, estimated by leaf-area index (LAI), affects LDD in deciduous forests. We found that the model, previously shown to accurately predict seed dispersal by wind, also reliably describes the effects of LAI variation on wind statistics for a wide range of canopy types. Sparser canopies are characterized by more organized vertical eddy motion that promotes LDD by uplifting seeds to higher elevations where winds are stronger. Yet, sparser canopies are also characterized by reduced mean windspeed aloft. We showed that former effect more than compensates for the latter, i.e., conditions of low LAI are favorable for LDD. This may account for the tendency of many temperate tree species to restrict seed release to either early spring or late fall, when LAI is relatively low. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the typical seasonal variation in LAI can be more important to LDD of seeds by wind than the natural variation in seed terminal velocity. Because our model accurately describes the effects of LAI variation for distinctly different sites, species, and life forms, we suggest that its results reflect a general association between LDD and foliage density dynamics.

AU  - Greene, D. F.
AU  - Johnson, E. A.
AB  - [Although there are many studies of wind dispersal of seeds from a forest into an adjacent clearing, no physical model has yet been advanced. The model constructed here calculates the trajectories of seeds from individual trees in the area source to a line of seed traps (in the clearing) oriented perpendicular to the forest edge. The model uses a log-normal distribution of horizontal wind velocities at a nearby reference station to evaluate wind velocities at any point in the forest and clearing as a function of both height above the ground and distance from the forest edge. The model predicts that (1) the slope of the area source dispersal curve (seed density vs. leeward distance) approximates a negative exponential; and (2) the great majority of seed deposition in the clearing is contributed by source trees lying within a few tree heights of the forest edge. An evaluation of previously published empirical data shows that the area source model adequately characterizes the decline in seed density with leeward distance.]

AB  - [1 In 1997, a major windstorm blew down over 10000 hectares of subalpine forest in Routt National Forest in north-western Colorado. We tested whether fire history and topographic variation, across the landscape, determined subsequent susceptibility to damage from this windstorm. 2 We combined dendrochronological techniques with a geographical information system (GIS) to examine the relationship between the effects of the blowdown and the spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation. We reconstructed the spatial fire history in a c. 4400 ha area by first identifying distinct patches in the landscape on aerial photographs, and then in the field by determining the disturbance history of each patch by dating fire scars, ages of post-fire cohorts and releases of remnant trees. 3 Both topographic position and fire history contribute to susceptibility to wind damage. Stands at higher elevations, on easterly slopes and closer to ridges were most affected. Younger stands (i.e. more recently affected by stand-initiating fires) were less affected particularly in areas affected by low-moderate severity blowdown (< 80% damage). The ecological effects of the very severe 1997 windstorm were mediated by the legacies of fires which occurred several centuries ago. Interactions between natural disturbances, such as fire and blowdown, lead to synergistic effects on forest dynamics, even when disturbance is infrequent.]

AB  - [Ice storms are an important and recurring ecological disturbance in many temperate forest ecosystems. In 1998, a severe ice storm damaged over ten million hectares of forest across northern New York State, eastern Canada, and New England impacting ecosystem processes across the landscape. This study investigated the spatial arrangement of forest damage at the terrestrial-aquatic interface, an ecological edge of importance to aquatic habitat and nutrient cycling. Vegetation indices, derived from satellite imagery and field-based data, were used to measure forest canopy damage across a 2045 km² region in northern New York State affected by the 1998 storm. We investigated the forest damage gradient in the riparian zone of 13 stream segments of varying size (92.5 km total length) and 13 lakes (37.4 km of shoreline). Large streams (-fourth and fifth order), occurring in forests that received modest ice damage (< 15% disturbance coverage), exhibited significantly more damage in the riparian zone within 25 m of the water than in adjacent forest sections; F(3,12) = 7.3 P = 0.005. In similar moderately damaged forests, lake shorelines were significantly more damaged than interior forests; F(3,9) = 6.4 P = 0.013. Analysis of transitions in damage intensity revealed that canopy disturbance followed a decreasing trend (up to 3.5 times less) with movement inland from the terrestrial-aquatic interface. The observed predisposition of forest to disturbance along this ecosystem interface emphasizes the role of the physical landscape in concentrating the movement of wood from the forest canopy to locations proximate to water bodies, thus reinforcing findings that ice storms are drivers of ecological processes that are spatially concentrated.]

TI  - Origin of a Park-Forest Vegetation Mosaic in the Wind River Range, Wyoming
AU  - Lynch, Elizabeth A.
AB  - [The vegetation of the montane and subalpine zones of the Rocky Mountains is a mosaic of conifer forests and large (1 ha to several square kilometers) treeless "parks" dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), grasses, and forbs. Three hypotheses for the origin of parks are proposed. The "permanent site hypothesis" states that the park-forest vegetation mosaic is a result of differences in physical characteristics of sites. In the "remnant hypothesis" parks are thought to be remnants of vegetation that was widespread under previous climate conditions. The "replacement hypothesis" states that parks replace forest vegetation in response to disturbance, climate change, or a combination of these two factors. Patterns in the past distribution of park and forest vegetation in the vicinity of Fish Creek Park (elevation 2750 m) were used to test these hypotheses. Fossil pollen extracted from the sediments of five small ponds in and around Fish Creek Park was used to reconstruct Holocene vegetation changes. Changes in vegetation were reconstructed through the use of multivariate analyses and pollen ratios derived from modern surface samples and by comparison with pollen data from other studies. The pollen record indicates that shortly after deglaciation (∼ 11 000 yr BP) the area supported alpine tundra, followed by whitebark pine-spruce-fir parkland at ∼ 9500 yr BP. From ∼ 8500 to 6000 yr BP, a pine parkland occupied the area, perhaps in response to climate conditions warmer than today. By 5000 yr BP a mixed pine-spruce-fir forest resembling the modern subalpine forest near Fish Creek Park probably replaced the pine parkland at all five sites. The modern park vegetation originated only within the last ∼ 2500 yr. The conversion to park vegetation may not have been synchronous at all three sites, and the replacement of forest by park did not always result in a long-term conversion to park vegetation. The timing and pattern of changes in the vegetation mosaic eliminate the permanent site and remnant hypotheses and suggest instead that climatic cooling over the last several thousand years, possibly combined with removal of forest cover by fire or some other disturbance, could explain the origin of Fish Creek Park.]
